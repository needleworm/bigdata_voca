This  is  generally  used  in  summer  for  the  circulation  of 
air.  In  Korea,  this  helps  to  keep  rooms  cool  and  shaded. 
This  also  makes  the  interior  of  a  room  almost  invisible  from 
the  outside.  Yet  this  allows  a  person  seated  inside  to  see 
out,  providing  some  privacy  even  when  windows  and  doors 
are  open.  Hung  above  a  door,  this  is  designed  to  be  rolled 
or  lifted  up.  Because  of  its  woven  patterns  and  decorative 
metal  hangers,  this  can  also  serve  as  a  wall  hanging.

19. 밑줄 친 cross의 뜻으로 가장 적절한 것은?

No  one  should  allow  himself  or  herself  to  be  emotionally 
hurt  by  anyone.  But  over  the  course  of  a  friendship,  even  the 
most  considerate  people  can  make  mistakes,  resulting 
in 
misunderstandings.  A  relationship  can  suffer  if  the  offender 
refuses  to  make  the  first  move  toward  reconciliation.  In  this 
situation,  it  may  be  best  if  the  offended  person  takes  the 
initiative  and  tries  to  restore  their  friendship. This  can  be 
done  by  discussing  why  one  person  got  cross  or  failed  to 
understand  the  circumstances.

21.

In  everyday  language,  we  talk  of  “my  place,”  “our 
home,”  and  “our  neighborhood.”  This  is  because  we 
think  of  our  home  as  our  own  private  territory.  People 
need  a  place  of  their  own,  where  they  can  get  away 
from  others  and  feel  a  sense  of  being  in  charge.  Even 
within  families,  we  attach  ourselves 
to  our  own 
territories.  For  example,  the  kitchen  tends  to  “belong” 
to  the  one  who  prepares  the  meals.  We  like  to  have 
our  own  workrooms  and  our  own  bedrooms,  or  at 
their 
least  our  own  side  of  the  bed!  People

22. The  great  fault  in  John’s  character  was  a  strong  dislike 
of  all  kinds  of 
.  This  was  not  from  a  lack 
of  diligence  or  perseverance.  He  would  carry  a  shotgun 
on  his  shoulder  for  hours  to  shoot  a  few  squirrels  or 
wild  pigeons,  and  he  was  always  first  to  appear  at 
local  events.  The  women  of  the  village  used  to  count 
on  him  to  run  their  errands,  and  he  would  never  refuse 
to  help  a  neighbor,  even  in  the  roughest  work.  As  for 
taking  care  of  his  own  family  and  keeping  his  farm  in 
order,  however,  he  found  these  tasks  impossible.  In  a 
word,  John  was  ready  to  attend  to  anybody’s  business 
but  his  own.

23. Thanks  to  the  printing  press,  the  display  of  royal  power 
could  now  be  depicted  in  printed  pictures,  which  were 
sold 
large  quantities.  Crowning 
ceremonies,  court  celebrations,  and  parades  for  military 
victories  could  now  all  be  seen  by  common  people 
who  had  never  been  to  the  capital.  The  state’s  power 
was  thus  brought  closer  to  the  people.  Even  the  king 
himself  could  now  be  seen  by 
                ,  too.  The  pictures  showed  people  what  their 
ruler  looked  like.  Not  surprisingly,  kings  ensured  that 
they  presented  themselves  as  impressively  as  possible, 
with  all  the  glory  of  their  dignity  and  power. 

① regarded  as  mysterious
③ represented  visibly

24. Whether  it  is  a  business-to-business  transaction  or  a  retail 
sale,  e-commerce  shifts  the  balance  of  power  in  favor  of 
the  customer.  This  happens  because 
. 
Instead  of  spending  hours  driving  around  comparison 
shopping,  a  Web  shopper  can  quickly  gather  information 
about  products  and  sellers  almost  anywhere.  Businesses 
have  found  that  the  real  distance  between  producers  and 
consumers  has  disappeared. 
this  new  economic 
situation,  the  buyer  is  king.  If  one  seller  cannot  deliver 
a  superior  product  at  a  competitive  price  in  real  time, 
another  seller  will.  The  realization  that  any  business  can

25. 다음 글에 나오는 Mike의 심경 변화를 가장 잘 나타낸 것은?

Watching  Uncle  Fred  rowing  the  boat  so  strongly  and 
so  easily  along,  Mike  began  to  feel  more  and  more 
jealous  of  him.  His  pride  began  to  whisper  that  he  could 
do  it.  The  little  boy  asked  again,  “Please,  I  want  to  row 
now.”  With  a  smile  Fred  said,  “It’s  not  as  easy  as  it 
looks.”  But  he  handed  him  the  oars,  knowing  the  water 
was  shallow.  The  boy  pulled  the  oars  back,  made  a  great 
dig  at  the  water,  and  missed  the  surface  altogether.  He 
fell  back  and  grabbed  at  the  side  of  boat.  Instantly  it 
turned  over.  The  struggling  boy  was  gripped  by  Fred  who 
was  already  standing  in  the  water.  Carried  to  the  shore  in 
his  uncle’s  arms,  the  boy  could  not  even  look  at  him.

to  make  cakes  and  other  foods.  There  are  also 
hundreds  of  ways  in  which  honey  is  used  today.  For 
example,  it  gives  f lavor  to  fruits,  candies,  and  baked 
goods.  It  has  been  used  in  healing  wounds  and  cuts.  It 
has  also  been  used  in  hand  lotions,  in  cigarettes,  in

The  combine  relieved  farmers  of  much  of  the  burden 
of  harvest.  It  enabled  farmers  to  rescue  crops  which 
otherwise  might  have  been  lost.  The  combine  was  first 
developed  for  use  in  countries  where  the  climate  was 
suitable  for  grain  production.  It  was  said  that  the  climate

Combines  work  in  quite  damp  conditions.  The  use  of  a 
combine  resulted  in  a  big  reduction  in  the  time  and 
labor  required  to  harvest  a  given  crop  because  only  one 
or,  at  the  most,  two  men  were  needed  to  operate  the 
machine.  Other  labor  required  to  transport  the  grain  to 
storage  was  not  excessive.

Distance  learning  has  recently  become  prominent  in  the 
field  of  further  education.  However,  much  about 
the 
processes  and  the  participants  involved  is  yet  to  be  fully 
understood.  Although  new  technologies  give  educational 
institutions  access  to  new  students,  they  provide  little 
meaningful  information  about  those  students.  Despite  the 
fact  that  the  prime  focus  has  been  placed  on  the  role  of 
technology 
learning,  experienced  educators

Patients  often  ask  me,  “Why  is  everything  I  enjoy  bad 
for  me?”  Well,  that’s  not  necessarily  true,  although  it 
often  seems  that  way.  For  example,  you  may  eat  all  the 
chocolate  you  like  as  long  as  your  body  can  stand  the 
extra  calories.  Do  you  like  eggs?  If  your  cholesterol 
level  is  normal,  you  may  have  three,  four  or  even  five 
eggs  a  week.  People  react  differently  to  cholesterol  in 
the  diet.  In  some,  it  raises  the  blood  levels,  while  in 
others,  it  does  not.  So,  if  you  love  eggs  and  chocolate, 
eat  some.  Just  don’t  go  overboard.

Cleanliness  is  next  to  godliness,  we  are  taught,  but 

is  it  possible  to  become  so  clean  that  it’s  not  good 

for  us?  That’s  the  question  posed  by  Dr.  Levy.  All 

that  washing  with  new  antibacterial  soaps  may  be 

damaging  our  immune  systems,  he  says.  He  contends 

that  it  is  killing  helpful  germs  and  encouraging  the 

growth  of  super  bacteria.

Dr.  Levy  longs  for  the  old  days  when  children  built 

strong  immune  systems  by  getting  dirty.  He  wants  us 

to  use  the  cleaners  our  parents  trusted:  plain  soap  and 

water.  Dr.  Levy  says  he  has  seen  no  evidence  to 

show  that  antibacterials  benefit  health.

“Our  passion  for  protecting  ourselves  from  every 

germ,  every  dog  hair,  and  every  piece  of  dust  might 

be  a  waste  of  time,”  Dr.  Levy  warns.  We  are  fast 

create  stories  that  can  be  easily  remembered  and  appeal

to  young  children  by  means  of  text  and  illustrations. 

that  even  the  unpleasantness  and  misfortunes  of  daily 

These  mutually  supporting  elements  are  often  seen  as 

life  knock  us  out.  We  know  now,  more  than  ever,

for 

the  young  child, 

there 

is  no 

separation  of 

text  and  pictures,  which  are  as 

interdependent  as  the  lyrics  and  melody  that  make  up

the  meaning  of  the  story.  When  a  child  is  undecided 

about  whether  she  likes  the  illustrations  or  the  text 

better,  therefore,  we  can  be  sure  that  a  good  match 

has  been  achieved.  The  best  picture  books 

thus 

contain  words  and  pictures  which  complement  each 

other  and  are  dependent  upon  each  other  to  the  point 

that  one  would  be  ineffective  without  the  other.

(A) Suppose  you  have  a 
tight  pair  of  red  shoes.   
Whenever  you  wear  them,  they  hurt.  So  you  want  to 
take  them  off  the  minute  you  put  them  on.

(B) In  the  same  way,  negative  reinforcement  tells  your 
child  only  what  will  bring  on  pain.  In  this  case,  the 
red  shoes  are  replaced  by  a  feeling  of  being  ignored 
or  of  stress  resulting  from  unexplained  punishment. 
The  negative  reinforcement  tells  the  child  what  not  to 
do,  without  indicating  what  he  or  she  should  do.
 
(C) The  use  of  negative  reinforcement,  therefore,  is

  Years  passed.  One  evening  the  town  council  held  its 
meeting.  As  they  reviewed  the  budget,  one  man’s  eye 
caught  the  salary  figure  being  paid  to  the  obscure  keeper 
of  the  spring.  Said  (c) the  keeper  of  the  purse,  “Who  is 
this  old  man?  Why  do  we  keep  him  on  year  after  year? 
For  all  we  know,  (d) the  strange  ranger  of  the  hills  is

slowly  and  ground  to  a  halt.  The  swans  left,  as  did 
the  tourists.   
  Immediately,  the  embarrassed  council  called  an  urgent 
meeting.  Realizing  their  gross  error  in  judgment,  they 
rehired  (e) the  old  keeper  of  the  spring,  and  within  a
