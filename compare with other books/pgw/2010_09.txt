This  is  used  in  product  manufacturing.  This  is  designed 
by  determining 
the 
manufacturing  of  each  product  component  as  well  as  the 
final  product.  Work  assignments,  the  number  of  machines, 
and  production  rates  are  coordinated  so  that  all  operations 
together.  All 
performed  along 
movement  of  product  parts  on  this  is  simplified,  with  no 
crossing  over,  backtracking,  or  repetition.  This  is  increasingly 
being  handled  by  computers,  which  monitor  information 
and  adjust  the  flow  of  parts  accordingly.  This  usually 
consists  of  conveyor  belts  on  which  workers  perform  specific 
functions.  Nowadays,  automatic  machinery  and  industrial 
robots  are  taking  the  place  of  human  workers  on  this.

For  a  year  Danny  had  trained  hard  to  master  the  famous 
Pikes  Peak  Marathon.  But  when  running  the  actual  marathon, 
he  was  feeling  weary  and  tired.  In  a  narrow  path  through 
the  woods,  ①he  got  stuck  behind  a  slow,  weak  runner  wearing 
a  T-shirt  with  ‘Bob’s  #4’  written  on  the  back.  ② He  felt 
even  more  tired  because  he  had  to  lag  behind  the  fellow. 
As  he  was  finally  overtaking  the  runner,  out  of  curiosity, 
③ he  asked  him,  “What’s  Bob’s  #4?”  “My  friend  Bob  had 
a  dream  to  run  this  marathon  four  times,”  he  answered. 
“④ He  ran  it  three  times,  but  then  last  year  he  died.  So  I 
decided  to  complete  his  dream  for  him.  This  is  Bob’s  #4.” 
Suddenly,  all  the  exhaustion  ⑤ he  had  been  feeling  during 
the  race  disappeared.

Mary’s  mother:  _____________________________________

① Great!  This  plant  is  very  expensive.
② Don’t  worry.  I’m  just  glad  you’re  not  hurt.

We  are  addicted  to  our  cars.  We  do  not  think  twice 
before  driving  to  pick  something  up  at  a  store  that  is 
only  three  blocks  away.  In  fact,  we  romanticize  driving 
with  our  thoughts  of  long  Sunday  drives  and  adventurous 
cross-country  road  trips.  Well,  we  need  to  get  rid  of  this 
addiction ― and  fast ― because  driving  is  harmful  to  our 
health  and  to  our  planet’s  health.  The  air  pollutants  that 
spit  out  from  the  car  exhaust  pipes  have  been  proven  to 
cause  cancer,  and  the  carbon  dioxide  that  is  emitted  causes 
global  warming.  One  of  the  easiest  ways  to  reduce  these 
emissions  is  simply  to  change  our  mind-set  about  driving. 
We  need  to  make  driving  our  last  choice  of  transportation 
to 
in 
achieving  this  new  mind-set  is  to  reorganize  our  lives  so 
we  do  not  need  to  drive  much  or  far.

live  a  happy,  healthy 

the  first  step 

life.  And 

① 가능하면 자동차 사용을 줄이자.
② 친환경 자동차 개발을 서두르자.
③ 타인을 배려하는 운전습관을 기르자.
④ 교통 법규를 준수하여 사고를 최소화하자.
⑤ 자동차를 이용한 여행 문화를 활성화시키자.

No  matter  what  we  are  shopping  for,  it  is  not  primarily 
a  brand  we  are  choosing,  but  a  culture,  or  rather  the 
people  associated  with  that  culture.  (A) Whatever / Whether  
you  wear  torn  jeans  or  like  to  recite  poetry,  by  doing  so 
you  make  a  statement  of  belonging  to  a  group  of  people. 
the 
Who  we  believe  we  are  (B) is / are  a  result  of 
choices  we  make  about  who  we  want  to  be  like,  and  we 
subsequently  demonstrate  this  desired  likeness  to  others 
in  various  and  often  subtle  ways.  Artificial  as  this  process 
is,  this  is  what  becomes  our  ‘identity,’  an  identity 
(C) grounded / grounding  on  all  the  superficial  differences 
we  distinguish  between  ourselves  and  others.  This,  after  all, 
is  what  we  are  shopping  for:  self-identity,  knowledge  of 
who  we  are.

Almost  every  day  I  play  a  game  with  myself  ① that  I 
call  ‘time  machine.’  I  made  it  up  in  response  to  my 
erroneous  belief  that  what  I  was  all  worked  up  about  was 
really  important.  ② To  play  ‘time  machine’  all  you  have  to 
do 
that  whatever  circumstance  you  are 
dealing  with  is  not  happening  right  now  but  a  year  from 
now.  It  might  be  an  argument  with  your  spouse,  a  mistake, 
or  a  lost  opportunity,  but  it  is  highly  ③ likely  that  a  year 
from  now  you  are  not  going  to  care.  It  will  be  one  more 
irrelevant  detail  in  your  life.  While  this  simple  game  will 
not  solve  ④ every  your  problems,  it  can  give  you  an  enormous 
amount  of  needed  perspective.  I  find  myself  laughing  at 
things  that  I  used  to  ⑤ take  far  too  seriously.

23. 다음 글에서 전체 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은?

There  are  some  areas  of  mathematics  where 

long, 
unpleasant  but  basically  routine  calculations  have  to  be  done, 
and  there  are  some  good  computer  programs  for  doing  them. 
① Thus,  computers  can  be  very  useful  time-saving  devices, 
sometimes  so  much  so  that  they  enable  mathematicians  to 
discover  results  that  they  could  not  have  discovered  on 
their  own.  ② Nevertheless,  the  kind  of  help  that  computers 
can  provide  is  very  limited.  ③ One  point  that  deserves  to  be 
made  is  that  the  lack  of  women  in  mathematics  is  another 
statistical  phenomenon.  ④ If  it  happens  that  your  problem, 
or  more  usually  sub-problem,  is  one  of  the  small  minority 
that  can  be  solved  by  a  long  and  repetitive  search,  then 
well  and  good.  ⑤ If,  on  the  other  hand,  you  are  stuck  and 
need  a  bright  idea,  then,  in  the  present  state  of  technology, 
a  computer  will  be  no  help  whatsoever.

24. Furniture 

is  among 

the  oldest  engineering  structures 
designed  to  carry  a  rather  well-defined  load  under  rather 
that 
well-defined  circumstances.  We  are  not  surprised 
furniture  used  beyond  its  intended  purpose  is  broken,  and 
we  readily  blame  the  child  who  abuses  the  furniture  rather 
than  the  designer  of  the  furniture  or  the  furniture  itself 
when  it  is  abused.  Thus  a  chair  must  support  a  person  in  a 
sitting  position,  but  it  might  not  be  expected  to  survive  a  fall 
from  a  tall  building.  A  child’s  bed  might  be  expected  to 
support  a  sleeping  child,  but  it  would  not  necessarily  be 
considered  badly  designed  if  it  collapsed  under  the  child’s 
wild  use  of  it  as  a  trampoline.  The  arms  and  legs  of  chairs, 
the  heads  and  feet  of  beds,  just  like  those  of  the  people 
whom  they  serve,  cannot  be  expected  to  be  ___________ 
without  limit.

25. A  vendor  in  a  city  set  up  shop  and  sold  doughnuts 
and  coffee  to  passersby.  During  the  breakfast  and  lunch 
hours,  he  always  had  long  lines  of  customers  waiting.  He 
noticed  that,  as  he  was  a  one-man  show,  the  biggest 
bottleneck  preventing  him  from  selling  more  doughnuts 
and  coffee  was  the  disproportionate  amount  of  time  it 
took 
to  make  change  for  his  customers.  Finally,  he 
simply  put  a  small  basket  on  the  side  of  his  stand  filled 
with  dollar  bills  and  coins.  Most  customers  responded  by 
being  completely  honest,  often  leaving  him  larger-than-normal 
tips.  Also,  he  was  able  to  move  customers  through  at 
twice  the  pace  because  he  did  not  have  to  make  change. 
In  addition,  he  found  that  his  customers  liked  this  idea 
and  kept  coming  back.  By  _______________  in  this  way, 
he  was  able  to  double  his  sales.

① refusing  change
③ using  a  new  recipe
⑤ making  tips  obligatory

② extending  trust
④ distributing  samples

26.  Few  things  hold  people  back  more  than  ________________. 
They  do  not  ask  for  what  they  need  because  the  answer  may 
be  no.  They  do  not  ask  their  boss  for  a  raise  or  for  more 
time  off.  They  are  afraid  to  be  the  first  to  say,  “I  love  you.” 
They  do  not  ask  for  help  from  people  they  do  not  know 
well.  In  short,  they  do  not  let  their  wants  and  needs  be 
known  because  they  are  afraid  of  being  turned  away.  But 
the  wonderful  truth  is  this:  If  you  can  accept  NO  for  an 
answer,  you  can  fearlessly  ask  for  whatever  you  need.  It  is 
also  true  that  you  will  not  receive  if  you  do  not  ask.  So 
do  not  be  afraid  to  ask!  You  may  be  surprised  at  the 
number  of  people  willing  to  help.

①  the  fear  of  rejection
③ the  shortage  of  time
⑤ the  excess  of  curiosity

② the  loss  of  patience
④ the  lack  of  knowledge

28.  The  spread  of  prosperity,  the  single-family  home, 
the  invention  of  television  and  computers  have  all  made 
it  possible  for  us  to  live  private  lives  unimaginable 
in  close 
to  previous  generations.  We  no 
quarters  with  our  neighbors,  we  can  move  about  without 
crowding  into  buses  or  trains;  we  do  not  have  to  go  to 
theaters  or  share  our  tastes  with  our  neighbors.  However, 
the  same  technologies  that  help  separate  us  from  the 
crowds  also  make  it  possible  to  monitor  and  record  our 
behaviors.  Although 
intimate 
knowledge  of  our  lives,  many  people ― mostly  unknown 
to  us ― know  something  about  us.  The  very  technology 
that  was  supposed  to  free  us  from  mass  society  has 
turned  out  to  be  as  much  a  fishbowl  as  an  information 
highway.  In  modern  society,  we  have  discovered  that

Efficiency  means  producing  a  specific  end  rapidly,  with  the 
(A) least / most  amount  of  cost.  The  idea  of  efficiency  is 
specific  to  the  interests  of  the  industry  or  business,  but  is 
typically  advertised  as  a  (B) loss / benefit  to  the  customer. 
Examples  are  plentiful:  the  salad  bars,  filling  your  own  cup, 
self-service  gasoline,  ATMs,  microwave  dinners  and  convenience 
stores  which  are  different  from  the  old-time  groceries  where 
you  gave  your  order  to  the  grocer.  The  interesting  element  here 
is  that  the  customer  often  ends  up  doing  the  work  that 
previously  was  done  for  them.  And  the  customer  ends  up 
(C) saving / spending  more  time  and  being  forced  to  learn  new 
technologies,  remember  more  numbers,  and  often  pay  higher 
prices  in  order  for  the  business  to  operate  more  efficiently, 
or  maintain  a  higher  profit  margin.

The  three  pictures  above  represent  a  model  of  the  effects  of 
global  warming  on  permafrost  regions.  Permafrost  is  frozen 
ground  that  remains  at  or  below  0℃  for  more  than  two 
years.  Most  of  the  world’s  permafrost  has  been  frozen  for 
millennia,  trapping  massive  amounts  of  carbon  in  organic 
material.  In  areas  of  extreme  cold  presented  in  Picture  1, 
permafrost  is  thousands  of  feet  thick  and  lies  ① below  a 
layer  of  soil  a  few  feet  deep  called  the  active  layer,  which 
freezes  and  thaws  with  the  seasons.  Where  the  average 
annual  air  temperature  is  slightly  below  freezing,  permafrost 
is  ② scattered  as  in  Picture  2.  Compared  to  Picture  1,  the 
permafrost  in  Picture  2  is  topped  by  a  ③ shallower  active 
layer.

My  mother  gave  me  some  strawberry  jam  to  take  to 
Mrs.  Sampson.  It  was  winter  and,  when  she  opened  the 
door,  I  was  overcome  by  the  smell  of  the  stove  and  the 
damp,  dark  atmosphere.  I  was  afraid  of  Mrs.  Sampson.  She 
was  a  big  woman  with  gray  skin,  like  clay,  with  a  couple 
of  gray  hairs  sticking  out  of  her  chin.  She  always  wore  a 
dirty,  mud-colored  cardigan  over  shapeless  dresses.  Worst 
of  all,  she  had  bad  breath!  “Here  you  are,  dear,”  she  said 
in  her  scratchy  voice,  and  put  a  dollar  bill  in  my  hand, 
“but  don’t  spend  it  all  at  once!”  I  fled,  back  to  the  relative 
safety  of  my  own  home.

American  culture  in  general  appears  suspicious  of  leisure. 
Some  people  believe  this  may  be  due  to  the  Protestant 
work  ethic.  Many  Americans  fill 
time  with 
intellectually  or  physically  demanding  hobbies  or  volunteer 
work.  Even  on  vacation,  Americans  stay  in  touch  with  the 
workplace  via  their  cellular  phones  and  laptop  computers.
        (A)        ,  Europeans  hold  leisure  in  high  regard.  A  new 
French  law  gave  France  the  shortest  work  week  in  Europe. 
Companies  with  more  than  twenty  employees  are  required 
to  cut  work  hours  from  39  to  35  per  week.  Besides  creating 
more  leisure  time  for  workers,  this  move  is  expected  to  help 
ease  unemployment.  In  Germany,          (B)        ,  longer  work 
weeks  may  soon  be  the  standard.  Its  low  birth  rate  has 
resulted  in  fewer  workers  supporting  more  and  more  retired 
Germans  in  the  generous  state  welfare  system.

33. Growing  native  plants  in  a  garden  is  catching  on  like 
wildfire.  Natives  often  attract  more  birds  and  pollinators 
such  as  bees  and  butterflies,  increasing  their  diversity  to 
your  garden.  Imitating  a  native  landscape  in  an  isolated 
urban  yard,  however,  does  not  do  all  that  much  to  make 
up  for  lost  native  habitat.  So  what  is  the  most  ecological 
use  of  your  garden?  At  the  top  of  the  list  is  gardening  for 
your  own  food.  There  is  no  reason  that  what  you  plant  for 
birds,  butterflies,  and  bees  cannot  also  feed  you  and  your 
family.  Sunflowers  are  often  called  ‘nature’s  bird  feeders,’ 
but  you  can  plant  enough  to  share  the  oil-rich  seeds.  Many 
fruit  trees  in  your  garden  can  also  feed  both  birds  and  you.

② necessities  of  preserving  the  native  landscapes

⑤ ecological  distinction  between  birds  and  pollinators

34. Conditioning  occurs  indirectly,  which  adds  to  its  impact 
on  us.  Let’s  say,  for  example,  that  you  watch  another  person 
get  an  electric  shock.  Each  time,  a  signal  light  comes  on 
before  the  shock  is  delivered.  Even  if  you  do  not  receive 
a  shock  yourself,  you  will  soon  develop  an  emotional 
response  to  the  light.  Children  who  learn  to  fear  thunder  by 
watching  their  parents  react  to  it  have  undergone  similar 
conditioning.  If  horror  movies  can  affect  us,  we  might 
expect  the  emotions  of  parents,  friends,  and  relatives  to 
have  even  more  impact.  How,  for  instance,  does  a  city 
child  learn  to  fear  snakes  and  respond  emotionally  to  mere 
pictures  of  them?  Being  told  that  “snakes  are  dangerous” 
may  not  explain  the  child’s  emotional  response.  More 
likely,  the  child  has  observed  others  reacting  fearfully  to 
the  word  snake  or  to  snake  images  on  television.

The  barrier  at  the  River  Scheldt  in  the  Netherlands  is 
the  world’s  largest  tidal  surge  barrier.  It  protects  Zeeland 
from  the  constant  threat  of  flooding.  Completed  in  1987, 
it  forms  part  of  the  Delta  Project,  a  line  of  massive 
sea-defenses,  which  was  constructed  after  disastrous  floods 
in  1953.  As  originally  planned,  the  barrier  was  to  be  a 
solid  dam

that,  by  drastically  restricting 
would  have  destroyed  much  of  the  marine  environment 
on  the  Eastern  Scheldt.  In  1973,  however,  a  campaign 
forced 
to  be  suspended.  The  project  was 
revived  four  years  later  in  a  new  and  greatly  modified 
form.  Instead  of  being  permanently  sealed,  the  redesigned 
barrier  is  now  normally  open  to  the  tides,  restricting  their 
flow  by  only  25  percent.  It  is  only  when  water  levels

38. precocial  birds에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?

The  young  of  precocial  birds  belonging  to  the  same 
clutch  have  a  strong  incentive  to  hatch  as  close  together 
in  time  as  possible.  The  mother  and  the  first-hatched 
young  will  be  on  the  move  within  hours;  chicks  left 
behind  in  the  eggs  will  die.  When  the  eggs  of  these 
species  are  incubated  separately,  the  hatching  times  are 
spread  over  a  period  of  days;  but  when  they  are  kept 
together,  hatching  times  are  close  by,  within  one  or  two 
hours.  This  coordinated  hatching  is  achieved  by  sound 
signals  exchanged  by  the  chicks  while  they  are  still  in 
the  eggs.  The  most  characteristic  sound  is  a  regular  loud 
click,  which  is  most  persistent  just  prior  to  hatching.  It  is 
not  caused  by  a  tapping  against  the  shell,  but  is  a 
vocalization  associated  with  breathing  movements.

39. We  know  where  we  are  headed  and  what  we  want  to  do. 
However,  quite  often,  due  to  forces  outside  our  control,  things 
do  not  go  as  we  had  planned  and  we  have  to  adjust  to 
a  postponement  or  create  a  whole  new  set  of  circumstances. 
This  is  what  happens  when  life  throws  us  a  curveball.  The 
fact  is  that  life  is  unpredictable.  For  example,  your  car 
breaks  down  and  you  are  late  for  an  appointment.  While  it 
is  true  that  you  never  arrive  at  that  important  meeting,  you 
end  up  spending  a  few  relaxing  hours  with  people  you 
would  never  have  met  otherwise.  Remember  that  not  only 
are  curveballs  the  universe’s  way  of  keeping  us  awake ―
which  is  a  gift  in  and  of  itself ― but  they  are  also  its 
method  of  bringing  us  wonderful  surprises.

and  a  fish.”  The  light  went  on  in  my  head.  Whenever  my 
son  did  what  I  wanted  him  to  do,  I  paid  little  attention  to 
him.  However,  when  he  did  not,  I  gave  him  a  lot  of 
attention  because  I  did  not  want  to  raise  a  bad  kid!  I  was 
unintentionally  teaching  him  to  be  a  little  monster  in  order

invent  things  that  appeal  to  our  senses ― fine  arts,  fine  food, 
fine  scents,  and  fine  music.  Art  has  mostly  been  considered 
in  terms  of  seeking  beauty,  but  there  are  other  reasons

But  the  strong  pig  can  race  to  the  dispenser  and  push 
the  weak  pig  aside  to  claim  the  leftovers.

Consider  the  following  experiment  with  a  strong  and  a 
weak  pig.  Two  pigs  are  kept  in  a  box  with  a  lever  at  one 
end  and  a  food  dispenser  at  the  other.  When  the  lever  is 
pushed,  food  appears  at  the  dispenser.  ( ① )  If  the  weak 
pig  pushes  the  lever,  the  strong  pig  waits  by  the  dispenser 
and  eats  all  the  food.  ( ② )  Even  if  the  weak  pig  races  to 
the  dispenser  before  the  food  is  gone,  the  strong  pig 
pushes  the  weak  pig  away.  ( ③ )  The  weak  pig  realizes 
this,  so  it  never  pushes  the  lever  first.  ( ④ )  On  the  other 
hand,  if  the  strong  pig  pushes  the  lever,  the  weak  pig 
waits  by  the  dispenser  and  eats  most  of  the  food.  ( ⑤ ) 
This  makes  it  worthwhile  for  the  strong  pig  to  push  the 
lever.  The  outcome  is  that  the  strong  pig  does  all  the  work 
and  the  weak  pig  does  most  of  the  eating.

As  we  explore  together  the  virtual  world  that  floats 
on  the  edge  of  this  material  life,  the  many  imaginative 
territories  you  inhabit  bring  back  another  reality.  I  catch 
images  of  my  own  childhood  wanderings 
through 
Narnia,  the  land  of  hobbits,  and  Mowgli’s  jungle.  All 
these  are  deep  pleasures  which  combine  all  my  senses 
and  momentarily  transport  me  into  another  dimension  of 
living.

If  I  were  to  bring  it  all  together  I  would  say  that 
among  all  the  misery,  fear,  injustice,  and  pain,  I  hope 
you  will  not  forget  moments  when  all  this  fades  away 
into  periods  of  innocent  joy.  It  is  when  we  bring  all 
our  powerful  senses  together,  perhaps  in  a  moment  in 
the  garden  of  earthly  delights  that  we                  over 
despair.

So  the  moment  when  you  dance  to  Handel  or  when 
you  sit  in  a  pool  of  wild  flowers,  or  gravely  take  part 
in  your  first  tea  ceremony,  these  are  the  moments  you 
treasure.  They  are,  with  similar  moments  with 
will

loved  ones,  what  makes  being  human 
bearable.

When  I  first  began  teaching,  I  was  invited  to  a 
workshop  for  new  professors.  Like  most  people  who 
teach  at  universities,  I  had  spent  a  long  time  learning 
what  to  teach,  but  none  learning  how  to  teach  it. 
Somehow,  my  university  seemed  to  hope,  a  weekend 
spent  with  experienced  professors  would  make  up  for 
that.  My  colleagues  presented  well-crafted  lectures  about 
the  tools  they  used  in  the  classroom.  I  enjoyed  their 
presentations,  but  do  not  remember  a  thing  they  said.

(A)

(B)

When  we  were  called  to  the  next  talk,  he  put  down  his 
cup  and  I  noticed  there  was  not  a  trace  of  coffee  in  it. 
I  thought  that  was  rather  odd,  and  said  so.  “My  doctor 
told  me  to  stop  drinking  coffee,”  he  explained.  “So  I 
have  always  used  an  empty  cup.  Doesn’t  make  any 
difference.”  I  decided  to  try  his  idea  in  my  class,  but  not 
with  an  empty  cup.

I  took  a  cup  of  coffee  with  me  to  my  next  class 
Monday  morning.  It  helped.  My  pauses,  as  I  drank  the 
coffee,  not  only  gave  my  students  time  to  think  about 
what  I  had  said,  but  gave  me  time  to  think  about  what 
I  was  going  to  say  next.  I  began  to  use  my  pauses  to 
look  around  the  room  to  see  how  my  students  were 
reacting  to  what  I  had  just  said.  When  I  saw  their 
attention  wander,  I  tried  to  bring  them  back.  When  I 
saw  them  puzzled  over  some  concept  that  I  thought  I 
had  explained,  I  gave  another  example.  My  lectures 
became 
less  brilliant,  but  my 
less  organized  and 
students  seemed  to  understand  me  better.

(C)

(D)

One  thing  that  I  do  remember  happened  at  a  coffee 
break.  Finding  myself  alone,  I  turned  to  a  mathematics 
professor  standing  nearby.  I  asked  him  what  his  favorite 
teaching  tool  was.  “A  cup  of  coffee,”  he  said.  I  asked 
him  how  he  used  it.  “Well,”  he  said,  “I  talk  too  much 
and  too  fast  in  the  classroom.  Students  sometimes  have 
trouble  following  me.  So  every  once  in  a  while,  when 
I’ve  said  something  I  want  my  students  to  think  about,  I 
stop  and  take  a  sip  of  coffee.  It  lets  what  I’ve  just  said 
sink  in.”
