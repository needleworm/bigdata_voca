A  traveler  came  to  an  inn  late  at  night.  There  was  only 
one  room  available  and  the  host  told  ① him  to  be  very 
careful  because  the  guest  in  the  next  room  was  a  very 
light  sleeper.  So  ② he  made  every  effort  to  be  silent  as 
he  got  ready  for  bed,  but  ③ he  dropped  one  shoe  by 
mistake,  making  a  crashing  sound  in  the  silence  of  the 
night.  Sure  enough,  it  awakened  the  man  next  door  and 
the  new  guest  heard  ④ him  toss  and  turn.  So  he  managed 
to  get  the  other  shoe  off  in  silence  and  got  into  bed.  Just

Of  all  animals,  they  have  most  closely  shared  in  human 
adventures  and  progress.  For  thousands  of  years,  they 
have  participated  in  the  pleasures,  the  dangers,  and  the 
hard  work  that  have  marked  human  life.  When  food 
became  scarce  in  one  area,  they  helped  people  move  to 
more  productive  areas.  They  carried  people  in  hunting 
fields,  in  polo  matches,  and  in  races.  Until  the  early 
1900s  they  were  a  vital  part  of  everyday  life.  After  the 
Industrial  Revolution,  machines  did  the  jobs  that  they  had 
done,  so  their  population  dropped  rapidly.

During  the  last  several  decades,  Asia’s  glaciers  have 
been  melting  at  an  alarming  rate.  According  to  Chinese 
researcher  Yao  Tandong,  annual  glacial  runoff  on  the 
Tibetan  Plateau  and  surrounding  areas 
is  roughly  20 
percent  more  than  that  of  40  years  ago.  Some  of  that 
water  is  f lowing  into  Asia’s  rivers,  increasing  f loods  and 
spreading  waterborne  diseases.  In  time,  the  problem  will 
reverse.  Yao  predicts  that  60  percent  of  the  glaciers  on  the 
Tibetan  Plateau  will  be  gone  by  the  end  of  the  century. 
“Once  the  rivers  decrease  and  finally  disappear,  oases  will 
dry  up  and  there  will  be  no  more  cities.”

Many  hands  make  light  work,  but  at  the  same  time,  too 
many  cooks  spoil  the  broth.  Which  of  these  contradictory 
proverbs  shall  we  believe?  ① Both,  because  in  different 
contexts,  both  are  true  to  experience.  ② If  not,  they 
probably  would  not  have  survived.  ③ Eventually,  a  lot  of 
proverbs  will  be  forgotten.  ④ If  the  job  to  be  done 
requires  lots  of  unskilled  labor,  such  as  picking  up  trash, 
then  many  hands  do  make  light  work.  ⑤ However,  if  the 
job  requires  complex  skills,  such  as  cooking  or  writing, 
then  too  many  cooks  do  spoil  the  broth.

25. While  humans  may  have  shifted  from  signs  to  speech 

long  ago,  Stokoe  and  Armstrong  don’t  want  people  to 
consider  sign  language  primitive ― just  the  opposite. 
“My  work  in  sign  language,”  says  Stokoe,  “is  to  let 
people  know  that  deaf  people  are  just  as  bright  and  able 
to  handle  abstract  thought  as  hearing  people,  given  equal 
education.  Prejudice  against  them  because  they  don’t 
speak  leads  to  all  sorts  of  bad  judgments  about  deaf 
people.  Recognizing  the  fact  that  we  all  probably  owe  a

distance  to  keep  from  freezing  and  from  getting  hurt 
by  other  porcupines.  Likewise,  we  need  to  get  close 
to  each  other  to  have  a  sense  of  community,  but  we 
need  to  keep  our  distance  from  each  other  to  preserve

Rick  Barry,  once  a  pro  basketball  player,  was  famous  for 
his  underhand  style  for  “free  throws.”  While  Barry  could 
easily  sink  nine  out  of  ten  shots,  others,  throwing  overhand, 
fell  far  short.  The  key  to  his  accurate  free  throws  lies  in  the 
arc  of  the  ball.  “Because  of  the  angle  into  the  basket  with 
a  typical  overhand  throw,  there  is  a  smaller  window  for  the 
ball  to  go  in,”  says  Brancazio,  a  physics  professor.  “If  the

We  all  make  mistakes,  have  to  deal  with  challenging 
colleagues,  and  face  situations  we  are  trying  to  turn 
around.  At  times  it’s  so  overwhelming  that  you  have  no 
understanding  of  the  situation.  Small  pains  seem  monumental, 
and  important  things  get  pushed  aside  as  if  they  were 
insignificant.  It’s  not  just  that  you  can’t  see  the  forest  for 
the  trees;  you’re  stuck  down  there,  covered  with  leaves. 
Here’s  what  to  do.  Rise  above  it.  Rise  so  far  above  it 
that  you  feel  10,000  feet  off  the  ground.  Then  you  will 
have  the  insight  you  need  to  sort  it  all  out.  You  will  see

If  you  have  ever  been  near  a  sparking  electric  motor 
or  a  copying  machine,  or  been  in  a  severe  lightning 
storm,  you  probably  have  smelled  ozone.  Its  odor  is 
unmistakable,  but  hard  to  describe.  Ozone  is  oxygen 
that  has  undergone  rearrangement  from  the  normal 
diatomic  molecule  (O2)  to  a  triatomic  form  (O3).  A 
simple  chemical  equation  summarizes  the  reaction:  3O2

The  word  paradigm  stems  from 

the  Greek  word 
paradeigma,  which  means  pattern.  Originally  it  was  a 
scientific  term  but  is  commonly  used  today  to  mean   
perception,  assumption,  theory,  or  frame  of  reference. 
It’s  like  a  map  of  a  territory.  An  accurate  paradigm 
explains  and  guides.  But

34. Role  theory  takes  the  view  that  consumer  behavior 
resembles  actions 
in  a  play.  As  people  act  out

Sculptor  Diane  Mason  grew  up 

Illinois, 
surrounded  by  chickens,  rabbits,  squirrels,  and  birds. 
Mason  recalls  that  she  didn’t  care  much  for  dolls  as  a 
little  girl,  but  that  she  was  fond  of  dressing  up  her 
favorite  chickens  in  miniature  clothes.  “We  had  some  very 
patient  chickens,”  she  laughs.  In  college,  Mason  majored 
in  ethology,  the  study  of  animal  behavior.  Today,  her 
fascination  with  animals  plays  a  major  role  in  her  artistic 
life.  She  combines  her  knowledge  about  animals  with 
humor  in  her  bronze  sculptures.  “Some  people  think  art 
has  to  be  about  anxiety,  but  I’m  trying  to  give  the  viewer 
a  little  something  to  smile  about.”

In  ancient  China,  people,  when  presenting  themselves 
before  a  superior,  knelt  down  and  bumped  their  heads  on

used  in  religious  ceremonies  when  people  came  to  make 
a  request  of  the  priest,  or  when  foreign  government 
officials  appeared  before  the  Chinese  emperor.  The  word 
kowtow  developed  from  a  combination  of  two  Chinese 
words,  a  verb  meaning  “to  knock”  and  a  noun  meaning 
to 
“head.”  Although  British  officials  were

Imagine 

the  average  workplace  of  1900 ― a  place 
without  calculators,  computers,  or  even  electricity  in 
many  places.  When  people  in  the  future  look  back  on 
2005,  what  tool  will  they  marvel  that  we  functioned 
without?  What  devices  will  become  commonplace  that 
nobody  has  yet  imagined?  People  capable  of  dealing

will  not  happen.  Unfor tunately,  the  need  for  a  100% 
guarantee  is  strengthened  by  several  forces  in  our 
relatively  safe  and  comfortable  modern  world.  Movies 
and  television  programs  confirm  the  illusion  that  all 
problems  can  be  easily  solved  and  that  life  should  be 
safe  and  wonderful.  We  don’t  like  to  face  the  truth 
that  uncertainty  is  a  part  of  life.  The  tendency  to  look 
for  someone  to  blame  when  something  goes  wrong 
implies  that  accidents  “should  not”  occur.  We  demand 
that  ou r  medicine,  transportation,  food,  and  everything 
else  be  100%  safe.  This  is  impossible.

When  I  was  in  school,  my  best  friend  was  a  young 
fellow  called  Shawn.  He  was  very  skilled  at  using  words. 
In  English  class,  whenever  we  had  to  write  an  essay,  he 
always  received  the  highest  mark.  Spending  time  with 
him  was  also  great  fun.  Whatever  Shawn  did,  I  wanted 
to  do,  too.  When  Shawn  decided  to  pursue  writing  as  a 
career,  I  made  the  same  choice. 

Becoming  a  physician  seemed  to  me  to  be  an  ideal 
way  to  begin  to  explore  the  human  mind.  I  thought  that 
the  human  body, 
the  mysteries  of 
by  understanding 
perhaps  I  could  someday  get  down  to  the  level  of  the 
soul.  If  I  had  not  met  Shawn,  I  might  never  have 
developed  my  love  of  literature  and  writing.  And  if  my 
father  had  acted  differently,  I  might  have  become  a 
journalist.  I  appreciate  both  Shawn  and  my  father  who 
led  me  to  the  life  I  enjoy  so  thoroughly  today.

My  father’s  dream  for  me,  however,  was  that  I  should 
become  a  physician.  When  we  sat  down  to  discuss  it,  I 
told  him,  “No,  I  don’t  want  to  be  a  doctor.  I  have  no 
interest  in  medicine.  I  want  to  be  a  great  writer  one 
day.”  Not  long  after,  on  my  fourteenth  birthday,  my 
father  gave  me  some  great  literature  to  read,  including 
Of  Human  Bondage  by  W.  Somerset  Maugham,  Arrowsmith 
by  Sinclair  Lewis,  and  Magnificent  Obsession  by  Lloyd 
C.  Douglas.  Although  he  didn’t  mention  it  at  the  time, 
all  these  books  were  about  doctors.  And  they  made  such 
a  deep  impression  that  they  sparked  in  me  a  desire  to 
become  one  myself.

I  have  a  friend  who  spent  most  of  his  adult  life 
insisting  he  couldn’t  write  a  book.  This  was  very 
puzzling  to  me,  because  not  only  was  he  an  excellent 
writer,  but  he  also  felt  quite  comfortable  writing  articles 
and  chapters!  One  day  I  asked  him  to  consider  the  idea 
that  a  book  is  nothing  more  than  a  series  of  interesting 
chapters  put  into  sequence.  Obvious  as  this  was  to  me, 
he  had  never  thought  of  it  in  those  terms.  Instead,  he 
had  always  focused  on  the  stubborn  belief  that  writing  a
