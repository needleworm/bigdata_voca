This  started  as  early  as  8000  B.C.  During  the  New 
fixed 
Stone  Age  as  people  began 
agricultural  communities,  this  intensified.  Originally  raised 
mainly  for  their  meat,  sheep  and  goats  became  valuable 
also  for  their  milk  and  wool.  Cattle  were  domesticated 
both 
for 
for  meat  and  skin  and  as  work  animals 
agriculture.  Their  milk  production  was  not  a  factor  until 
in  history  when  breeding  for  high  milk 
much 
production  produced  suitable  cows.  Horses  were  also 
domesticated  and  became  important  for  transportation  and 
came  to  play  a  major  part  in  warfare.

A  woman  stopped  at  a  flower  shop  to  order  some  flowers  to 
be  wired  to  her  mother  who  lived  100  miles  away.  As  ① she 
got  out  of  her  car,  she  noticed  a  girl  sitting  on  the  street 
sobbing.  The  woman  asked  the  girl  what  was  wrong  and  she 
replied,  “I  wanted  to  buy  a  red  rose  for  my  mother,  but  I  only 
have  75  cents  and  a  rose  costs  two  dollars.”  ② She  smiled  and 
said,  “Come  on  in  with  me.  I’ll  buy  you  a  rose  for  your 
mother.”  ③ She  placed  her  order  of  flowers  to  her  mother  and 
bought  a  rose  for  the  girl.  As  they  were  leaving,  she  offered 
the  girl  a  ride.  ④ She  responded,  “Yes,  please,  if  you  could. 
Take  me  to  my  mother.”  The  little  girl  directed  her  to  a 
grave  and  placed  the  rose  on  it.  This  changed  the  woman’s 
plan!  ⑤ She  returned  to  the  flower  shop,  canceled  the  wire 
order,  picked  up  a  bouquet  of  fresh  roses,  and  drove  100 
miles  to  meet  her  mother.

Mr.  Brown  wanted  his  students  to  learn  math  in  the 
context  of  real  life.  He  felt  it  was  not  enough  for  them 
just  to  work  out  problems  from  a  book.  To  show  his 
students  how  math  could  really  help  ① them,  he  held 
several  contests  during  the  year.  The  contests  allowed  his 
students  ② to  have  fun  while  they  practiced  math  and 
raised  money.  Once  he  filled  a  fishbowl  with  marbles, 
asked  the  students 
to  guess  how  many  marbles  there 
were,  and  ③ awarded  a  free  lunch  to  the  winner.  Another 
time  they  entered  a  contest  to  guess  how  many  soda  cans 
the  back  of  a  pickup  truck  ④ was  held.  To  win,  they 
had  to  practice  their  skills  at  estimating,  multiplying, 
dividing,  and  measuring.  They  used  ⑤ most  of  the  prize

It  is  hard  for  street  trees  to  survive  with  only  foot-square 
holes  in  the  pavement.  The  average  life  of  a  street  tree 
surrounded  by  concrete  and  asphalt  (A) is / are seven  to 
fifteen  years.  Many  factors  underground  determine  if  a 
street  tree  will  make  it.  If  the  soil  is  so  dense  that  the 
roots  cannot  get  in,  it  will  surely  die.  If  they  can  get  in, 
there  is  a  better  chance  of  getting  the  water  and  nutrients 
(B) needing / needed to  survive.  Another  question  is  whether 
adequate  water  supplies  are  getting  into  the  growing  area. 
Some  of  the  water  comes  from  underground  sources  and 
some  from  rain,  and  it  is  hard  to  measure  (C) where / what
the  tree  is  getting  it.  Of  course,  if  the  roots  get  into  the 
sewers,  they  can  get  everything  they  need.

If  you  lead  a  busy  life  and  are  short  of  time,  you  may 
find  that  you  are  eating  a  full  meal  only  about  once  a  day. 
① From  the  standpoint  of  health  this  is  a  bad  practice.  ② You 
would  be  treating  your  body  with  more  consideration  if 
you  had  several  small  meals  instead  of  a  single  big  one. 
③ A  given  amount  of  food  is  used  more  efficiently  by  the 
body  if  it  is  spaced  throughout  the  day  rather  than  eaten  at 
one  sitting.  ④ Such  symptoms  are  likely  to  occur  in  people 
who  drink  more  than  five  cups  of  strong  black  coffee  in  a 
single  day.  ⑤ People  who  have  large,  infrequent  meals  tend 
to  gain  more  weight  and  to  have  a  higher  level  of  fat  in  the 
blood  than  do  those  who  eat  smaller  quantities  (but  the 
same  total)  at  regular  intervals.

23. We  push  down  our  feelings  because  most  of  us  have 
been  brought  up  to  believe  that  there  are  feelings  which  are 
unacceptable.  Some  of  us  learned  that  all  emotions  are 
unacceptable,  while  others  learned  that  specific  emotions 
such  as  anger  or  crying  are  unacceptable.  In  fact,  there  is 
absolutely  nothing  wrong  with  any  kind  of  feeling.  When 
someone  tells  you  not  to  feel  sad  or  angry,  he  or  she  is 
asking  the  impossible.  You  can  deny  the  feelings  you  are 
having  but  you  cannot  stop  them  from  coming.  All  that 
feelings  need,  in  order  to  pass,  is  to  be  acknowledged  and 
accepted.  Just  saying  to  yourself,  or  someone  else,  ‘I  feel 
angry’  (or  sad,  or  frightened)  is  a  great  start.  Let  yourself 
_________  the  feelings,  good  or  bad.

④ choose

They  avoid,  whenever  possible,  situations  that  may  bring 
about  physical  deprivation,  including  pain,  hunger,  and  a 
need  for  sleep.  Much  contemporary  advertising  promises 
these  satisfactions,  whether  from  headache  remedies, 
fancy  foods,  or  form-fitting  mattresses.  An  individual 
can  suffer  any  of  these  deprivations  temporarily,  however, 
and  he  may  knowingly  enter  into  situations  which  will 
deprive  him  for  a  time  if  he  believes  that  there  will  be

25. No  matter  how  we  shake  or  tap  the  bottle  of  ketchup, 
some  of  it  refuses  to  come  out.  In  some  cases,  up  to  20 
percent  of  the  product  is  left  in  the  packaging  when  it 
is  thrown  out.  This  is  not  only  annoying  for  consumers 
but  also  poses  difficulties  when  recycling:  The  leftovers 
first  have  to  be  removed  from  the  packaging,  which  is 
expensive,  time-consuming,  and  uses  a  great  deal  of 
water.  A  German  project  by  the  Fraunhofer  Institutes, 
together  with  Munich  University  of  Technology  and 
various  industrial  partners,  will  put  an  end  to  this  dilemma. 
Researchers  are  applying  thin  films,  no  more  than  20 
nanometers  thick,  to  the  inside  surface  of  packaging  in 
order  to  _____________________.

① keep  ketchup  fresh
③ develop  nanotechnology ④ reduce  leftover  traces
⑤ increase  the  price  of  ketchup

② remove  tap  water

26. When  we  have  made  an  error,  as  for  example  in 
adding  up  a  column  of  figures,  we  have  a  tendency  to 
repeat  it  again  and  again.  This  phenomenon  is  known  as 
the  persistent  error.  The  same  thing  happens  when  we  try 
to  solve  a  problem;  each  time  our  thoughts  take  a  certain 
course,  that  course  is  more  likely  to  be  followed  the  next 
time.  The  reason  that  we  keep  making  the  same  error 
repeatedly  is  that  associations  form  between  the  ideas  in 
the  chain  of  thoughts  and  become  firmer  each  time  they 
the  connections  are  so  well 
are  used,  until 
established  that  ___________________________________. 
Thus,  once  we  have  adopted  an  unprofitable  line  of 
thought,  it  is  harder  to  adopt  a  profitable  line. 

finally 

① the  chain  is  very  difficult  to  break
② persistent  problems  are  solved  automatically
③ the  ideas  lose  their  associations  with  one  another
④ those  connections  become  weaker  as  time  goes  by
⑤ the  phenomenon  will  lead  to  a  profitable  line  of  thought

27. About  three  percent  of  the  weight  of  sea  water  is  accounted 
for  by  salt.  The  salt  content  of  the  ocean  is  being  continually 
added  to  by  runoff  from  the  land,  but  it  is  not  increasing.  Yet 
salt  cannot  leave  the  sea  by  evaporation  because  the  water 
vapor  leaves  it  behind.  So  for  many  years  it  was  a  mystery  as 
to  why  the  sea  should  ________________,  given  the  rate  of 
runoff,  and  particularly  if  the  world  was  supposed  to  be 
hundreds  of  millions  of  years  old.  The  riddle  was  not  solved 
until 
the  deep  ocean  openings  were 
discovered.  Sea  water  is  swallowed  up  by  these  cracks  in  the 
ocean  bed;  when  it  reemerges,  millions  of  years  later,  as  steam 
from  volcanoes,  the  salt  has  been  filtered  out  of  it  on  its 
passage  through  the  rocks.

② create  so  much  runoff 
③ have  so  little  salt  in  it
④ have  so  many  volcanoes

A  blind  spot  is  not  the  same  as  a  simple  lack  of  knowledge. 
A  blind  spot  emerges  from  a  (A) resistance / connection to 
learning  in  a  particular  area.  At  the  root  of  many  of  our  blind 
spots  are  a  number  of  emotions  or  attitudes ― fear  being  the 
most  obvious,  but  also  pride,  self-satisfaction,  and  anxiety.  A 
manager,  for  example,  might  have  unsurpassed  knowledge 
in  the  financial  field,  but  her  understanding  of  people 
management  might  be  (B) flooded / limited .  Her  people  find

I  start  my  long  journey  with  great  enthusiasm.  The 
thought  of  conquering 
the  mountain  stirs  me  with 
anticipation.  Although  the  freezing  wind  pounds  upon  me, 
I  feel  flushed  with  warmth.  Just  after  ten  o’clock  in  the 
morning,  I  finally  put  my  step  on  the  ice-covered  peak  of 
the  mountain.  A  childlike  joy  spreads  through  me.  I  am 
the  two  hundred  and  ninth  person  to  stand  on  the  summit 
of  Mount  Everest.  My  heart  races  as  I 
this 
glorious  moment.  The  sky  is  deep  blue  and  cloudless.  For 
fifteen  minutes  I  cherish  the  view  as  the  highest  person 
on  earth.  I  do  not  feel  the  tiredness  in  my  legs,  for  the 
journey  has  been  truly  worthwhile.

The  figure  above  shows  the  equipment  for  downhill  and 
cross-country  skiing  and  their  recommended  sizes.  As  you 
can  see,  the  downhill  ski  is  ① shorter  and  wider  than  the 
cross-country  ski  and  is  about  the  height  of  the  skier.  The 
cross-country  ski  meets  the  ② elbow  when  the  arm  is  held 
above  the  head.  In  either  case,  a  slightly  heavier  or  more 
experienced  skier  might  want  a  longer  ski,  and  a  lighter  or 
beginning  skier  might  prefer  a  shorter  ski.  The  cross-country 
pole  is  longer  than  the  one  for  downhill  skiing,  and  its  tip  is 
③ bent.  The  length  of  the  cross-country  pole  reaches  the 
armpit.  The  downhill  pole  fits  comfortably  in  the  hand  about 
two  inches  ④ below  the  armpit.  The  bottom  of  the  downhill 
boot  attaches  completely  to  the  ski,  while  the  ⑤ heel  of  the 
cross-country  boot  is  not  fastened  to  the  ski.

32. Sometimes  all  a  good  cheese  needs  to  stop  it  from  going 
bad  is  a  sympathetic  ear.  Researchers  in  France  have  come 
up  with  an  ultrasonic  sensor  that  will  listen  to  cheese  as  it 
matures  and  warn  cheese  makers  of  defects.  Cheese  makers 
have  to  downgrade  up  to  one-fifth  of  their  produce  because 
of  undetected  faults.  If  the  new  device  works  well,  that 
problem  could  be  reduced.  The  technique  involves  sending 
a  low  frequency  ultrasonic  signal  through  the  cheese  to  a 
sensor  at  the  other  side.  By  measuring  the  change  in  the 
speed  and  size  of  the  emerging  signal,  the  moisture  and 
porosity  of  the  cheese  can  be  mapped.

33. Nobody 

likes  performance 

reviews.  Employees  are 
nervous  they  will  hear  nothing  but  criticism,  and  bosses  are 
nervous  their  direct  reports  will  respond  defensively.  So 
people  generally  keep  their  mouths  shut.  That  is  unfortunate 
because  most  employees  need  help  figuring  out  how  to 
improve  their  performance  and  advance  their  careers.  Also, 
it  can  be  harmful  to  the  company  if  a  lack  of  clear  feedback 
leads  to  undesirable  work  behaviors.  There  is  a  way  to  avoid 
this  problem.  Managers  can  help  employees  learn  adaptive 
techniques ― like  acknowledging  negative  emotions  and 
reframing  fears  and  criticisms  constructively ― to  prevent

Composers  describe  their  private  world  through  the  use  of 
sound.  Making  such  a  description  concrete  and  detailed 
requires  not  just  inspiration  but  certain  practical  tools  and 
skills.  No  matter  what  style  of  music  you  write,  you  need  to 
understand  dynamics  and  speed,  the  uses  of  harmony  and 
rhythm.  You  also  need  to  know  the  range  and  capabilities  of 
instruments,  the  possibilities  of  the  human  voice,  and  the 
problems  of  acoustics.  You  need  to  be  able  to  devise  a 
blueprint  that  communicates  to  your  musicians  what  it  is  you 
want  to  hear.  A  young  composer  who  takes  a  shortcut  in  this 
technical  training  in  his  rush  to  play  the  role  of  a  composer 
will  dry  up  very  fast.  If  you  learn  the  proper  techniques,  then 
the  passion,  if  it  is  genuine,  will  come  through.

Costa  Rica  means  ‘rich  coast’  in  Spanish.  It  was 
discovered  in  1502  and  named  by  Christopher  Columbus, 
who  thought  it  might  be  a  land  rich  with  gold.  However, 
Costa  Rica  has  no  great  mineral  wealth.  It  has,  instead, 
rich  soil  and  a  moderate  climate.  While  other  Latin 
American  nations  suffered  exploitation  from  outside  the  region 
and  developed  societies  split  by  class  conflict  between 
rich  and  poor,  Costa  Rica  developed  an  agricultural 
economy  made  up  of  numerous  small  farmers.  There  was 
not  great  wealth,  but  what  there  was  was  spread  evenly. 
Costa  Rica  continued  its  unusual  development  after  it 
separated  from  Spain  in  1821,  becoming  the  first  Latin 
American  country  to  abolish  slavery.  In  1889  the  little 
nation  held  the  first  free  election  in  Latin  America.

In  the  early  1960s,  Jill  Norris,  the  mother  of  two  sons  with 
learning  difficulties,  began  to  exchange  appropriate  toys  with 
other  families;  out  of  this  she  founded  the  Toy  Libraries 
Association (TLA).  The  association  opened  toy  libraries  in 
community  centers,  clinics,  schools,  public  libraries,  and 
hospitals  around  the  world.  From  these  toy  libraries  parents 
and  children  could  borrow  toys  knowing  that  they  have  been 
thoroughly  tried  and  tested,  not  only  for  their  play  value  but 
also  for  safety.  Over  the  years,  the  association  has  involved 
therapists,  alongside 
leading  professional  educators  and 
parents,  in  the  production  of  numerous  publications  on  specific 
toys  and  aspects  of  play.  In  its  early  years,  the  association  was 
opposed  by  the  toy  industry  because  it  was  likely  to  reduce 
sales  of  toys  as  children  were  borrowing  them.

38. Clients  send  a  steady  stream  of  clues  and  messages  through 
their  facial  expression,  body  movement,  and  voice  pitch. 
Counselors  need  to  learn  how  to  read  these  messages  without 
distorting  or  overinterpreting  them  in  order  to  establish  and 
maintain  relationships  with  their  clients.  For  instance,  when 
Denise  says  to  Jennie,  “It  seems  that  it’s  hard  for  you  to  talk 
about  yourself,”  Jennie  says,  “No,  I  don’t  mind  at  all.”  But  the 
real  answer  is  probably  in  her  nonverbal  behavior,  for  she 
speaks  hesitatingly  while  looking  away  and  frowning.  Reading 
such  clues  helps  Denise  understand  Jennie  better.  Our 
nonverbal  behavior  has  a  way  of  ‘leaking’  messages  about 
what  we  really  mean.  The  unplanned  nature  of  nonverbal 
behavior  contributes  to  this  leakage  even  in  the  case  of  highly 
defensive  clients.

39. Sweeping  statements  have  been  made  about  the  effect  of 
clothing  on  the  behavior  of  a  child.  It  has  been  said  that  a 
child  who  is  better  dressed  is  better  behaved,  and  that  a  child 
who  is  dressed  like  a  cowboy  is  louder  than  he  is  when 
dressed  in  ordinary  clothes.  Clothing,  however,  might  have  a 
temporary  effect  on  the  behavior  of  the  child,  but  not  a  lasting 
effect.  That  is,  we  would  predict  that  a  child  who  was  dressed 
in  his  best  clothes  and  whose  mother  stressed  that  they  were 
‘best’  would  be  better  behaved  for  a  short  period,  but  by  the 
end  of  the  hour  the  child  would  have  forgotten  his  clothes  and 
would  be  acting  as  he  would  in  old  clothes.  Likewise,  the  child 
who  is  dressed  in  a  cowboy  outfit  might  be  very  noisy  while 
playing  cowboys  for  a  brief  time,  but  he  might  soon  change 
to  another  activity  and  be  no  more  noisy  than  usual.

Due  to  this  trade,  the  plant  variety  became  widespread 
in  a  region. 

For  thousands  of  years,  farmers  at  harvest  time  have 
selected  seeds,  cuttings,  or  tubers  from  superior  plants  to 
save  for  the  next  planting.  ( ① )  Farmers  often  protected  the 
stored  seeds  from  insects  or  animals  by  sealing  them  in  clay 
pots  or  burying  them  in  baskets  covered  with  ash.  ( ② ) 
They  also  often  stored  tubers  in  cold  areas  and  either 
replanted  cuttings  immediately  or  kept  them  dry  until  the 
next  planting  time.  ( ③ )  Farmers  thus  saved  their  genetic 
stocks  from  season  to  season.  ( ④ )  They  could  exchange 
remaining  stocks  with  neighbors  or  exchange  them  in  the 
local  market.  ( ⑤ )  Organized  seed  production,  however,  did 
not  begin  until  the  early  1900s.

41. A  study  found  that  enrollment  in  physical  education

but  involvement  in  vigorous  physical  activity  was.  Students 
who  engaged  in  vigorous  activity  outside  of  school  at  least 
20  minutes  per  day,  three  days  per  week,  were  found  to 
have  higher  academic  scores.  Students  in  the  physical 
education  class  spent  an  average  of  only  19  minutes  out  of 
a  55-minute  class  engaged  in  moderate-to-vigorous  physical 
activity.  Given  that  this  amount  and  intensity  of  activity  in 
physical  education  classes  had  no  correlation  to  students’ 
academic  achievement,  whereas  there  was  a  significant 
association  between  academic  achievement  and  vigorous 
activity  outside  of  school,  the  researchers  propose  that  there 
may  be  a  certain  minimum  level  of  activity  necessary  to 
produce  the  potentially  desirable  effects.

42. The  tragic  heroes  in  Shakespeare’s  plays  have  free

Othello  is  jealous;  Hamlet  cannot  make  up  his  mind ― but 
all  three  might  have  made  themselves  into  better  human 
beings.  Nothing  outside  themselves  prevents  them  from 
taking  the  right  path  as  opposed  to  the  wrong,  or  tragic, 
path.  On 
in  Greek

there  is  no  free  will.  The  gods  control  a  man’s  destiny,

When  we  look  at  the  world  and  ourselves,  we  do  it 
through  a  set  of  filters.  Think  about  what  a  filter  is.  A 
filter  is  a  mechanism  that  lets  some  things  flow  in  but 
screens  other  things  out. 

(A) Through  them,  we  process  and  assign  a  weight  and 
meaning  to  every  event  in  our  lives.  Some  things 
flow  in,  others  are  screened  out,  but  everything  is 
affected:  not  just  what  we  ‘see,’  but  what  we  ‘hear’ 
and  ‘believe.’

(B) Depending  on  what  the  filter  is  made  up  of,  it  can 
also  alter  whatever  is  looked  at  or  passes  through  it. 
Sunglasses  are  a  good  example  of  a  visual  filter.

The  descriptions  of  sound  production  have  been 
rewritten  in  this  edition  so  as  to  update  the  theory  on 
which  they  were  based  and  to  provide  better  practical 
advice  regarding  pronunciation  problems.  Several  figures 
have  been  redrawn  in  order  to  achieve  greater  accuracy 
and  clearer  detail.  The  authors  have  tried  to  eliminate 
traces  of  gender-biased  attitudes  wherever 
they  were 
detected,  and  a  definite  attempt  has  been  made  to  balance 
female  and  male  references.  The  most  significant  kind  of 
change  in  the  new  edition,  however,  is  the  result  of  the 
effort  we  have  made  to  introduce  more  use  of  language 
for  real  communicative  purposes  in  the  learning  activities 
suggested  for  students  to  carry  out.

The  introduction  of  the  player  piano  in  the  United  States 
at  the  turn  of  the  20th  century  had  been  accompanied 
by  fairly  critical  comments.  Player  pianos  produced 
music  mechanically  through  a  set  of  instructions  stored 
on  a  music  roll.  Although  proponents  of  the  player  piano 
such  as  piano  manufacturers  and  publishers  of  sheet 
music  thought  that  it  would  lead  to  ‘an  almost  universal 
music  education,’  many  music  teachers,  musicians,  and 
composers  opposed  it.  Opponents  claimed  that  one  could 
copy  sound,  but  not  interpretation,  and  that  mechanical 
instruments 
to 
mathematical  systems.  For  this  reason,  they  believed  that 
mechanized  music  lessened  the  ideal  of  beauty  by 
‘producing  the  same  after  same,  with  no  soul,  no  joy,  no 
passion,’  and  that  the  introduction  of  the  player  piano

Several  years  ago,  we  were  asked  to  help  with  the 
merger  of  two  community  volunteer  groups,  who  wanted 
to  join  together  in  order  to  establish  an  agency  that 
would  have  more  influence  and  better  financing  than  the 
the  past.  Both  were  rural 
two  separate  agencies  of 
groups,  which  had  traditionally  and  geographically  been 
separated  by  a  range  of  mountains.

In  leading  the  planning  meetings  of  the  two  boards,  he 
carefully  kept  the  groups  focused  on  the  long-range  issues, 
and  convinced  them  not  to  look  at  the  headquarters 
question  until  the  very  end  of  the  process.  Once  the 
organizational  structure  was  set,  by-laws  agreed  upon, 
and  all  the  volunteers  had  actually  merged,  then  the 
headquarters  site  was  decided  on ― logically  and  easily, 
as  it  turned  out. 

We  worked  with  the  two  groups  to  help  them  set  goals, 
develop  policy,  and  build  an  organizational  structure. 
Meanwhile,  the  young  executive  director,  who  saw  a 
successful  merger  as  his  primary  responsibility,  was 
especially  careful  about  one  thing.  On  either  side  of  the 
mountain  was  a  large  town.  Each  of  the  former  agencies 
had  its  own  board,  a  separate  staff,  and  long-standing 
regional  ties.  The  executive  director  understood  that  the 
question  of  where  the  new  joint  agency’s  headquarters 
would  be  was  an  important  question  as  well  as  a  potentially 
explosive  one. 

(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

By  then  everyone  was  so  committed  to  the  organization 
and  its  goals  that  the  headquarters  question  had  become  a 
relatively  unimportant,  routine  one.  The  executive  director 
of  the  merging  agencies  was  primarily  concerned  about 
the  long-range  good  of  the  organization  and  the  total 
community.  He  used  all  his  influence  and  persuasive 
powers  to  make  that  a  common  focus,  and  the  results 
were  successful.

It  was  spring  and  some  6th  grade  boys  at  a  suburban 
elementary 
the 
playground.  They  had  discovered  a  great  new  trick.  One 
of  them  would  kneel  down  behind  someone  and  the 
other  would  push  the  person  over.  The  trick  worked 
perfectly  with  (a) Anna.  She  fell  over  with  ease.  She 
was  hurt  and  crying.  In  the  process  (b) she  had  broken 
her  wrist.  The  yard  duty  staff  sent  the  shaken  boys  to 
the  principal. 

The  principal  began  by  saying  that  she  understood  that 
they  were  playing  and  had  not  meant  to  cause  serious 
harm,  but  that,  in  fact,  they  had.  She  explained  that  the 
girl  would  have  to  wear  a  cast  for  weeks  and  now  lots 
of  ordinary  things  would  be  more  difficult  for  (c) her. 
She  pointed  out  that  the  girl  played  the  flute  and  would 
now  not  be  able  to  play  in  the  spring  concert.  By  the  time 
(d) she  finished,  the  boys  were  in  tears  and  very  sorry 
for  what  they  had  done.  The  principal  also  suspended 
the  boys  for  a  day,  explaining  to  them  that  even  though 
she  knew  they  were  sorry  and  had  not  meant  to  cause 
to 
such  harm,  she  believed  suspension  was  necessary 
signal  to  everyone  in  the  community  the  seriousness  of 
the  situation.  On  their  own,  the  boys  brought  (e) the  girl 
flowers  and  apologized  for  hurting  her.
