Great  voyagers,  Polynesians  from  the  Marquesas  Islands 
migrated  to  Hawaii  over  1,600  years  ago.  ① They  were 
good  at  navigation.  ② They  sailed  across  2,400  miles  of 
open  ocean  in  large  canoes,  navigating  by  the  sun  and 
stars.  ③ They  brought  along 
their 
survival:  pigs  and  chickens;  sweet  potatoes  and  coconuts; 
and  other  edible  and  medicinal  plants.  ④ They  governed 
the  islands  for  800  years.  However,  their  rule  ended 
the  Society 
when  another  group  of  Polynesians  from 
Islands  arrived.  ⑤ They  became 
rulers  of 
Hawaii,  claiming  to  be  descendants  from  the  greatest 
gods.

A  poem  will  live  or  die  depending  on  how  it  is  read. 
There  are  a  few  pointers  about  the  oral  recitation  of 
poetry. ① Read 
the  poem  once  slowly  aloud  without 
writing  or  marking  anything. ② Listen  closely  when  the 
presenter  reads  the  poem. ③ Don’t  stop  until  you  finish

  .  When  I  would  bring  him  what  I  thought  was  a 
finished  piece  of  work,  he  would  read  it  quietly  and 
take  out  his  pen.  As  I  watched  over  his  shoulder,  he 
would  cross  out  whole  lines,  turn  clauses  into  phrases, 
and  turn  phrases  into  single  words.  One  day  at  lunch, 
I  asked  him  how  he  did  it.  He  shrugged  and  said, 
“It’s  not  hard ― just  omit  the  surplus  words.”

25. One  of  the  forces  that  drive  evolution  is 

among  species,  in  the  course  of  which  one  species  gains 
temporary  advantage  through  an  evolutionary  innovation,
only  to  be  overtaken  by  a  counter-innovation.  The
outcome  is  the  development  of  apparently  better  ways  of 
doing  things,  such  as  running  faster,  or  being  smarter, 
while  no  permanent  advantage 
is  secured.  In  military 
terms,  this  process  is  known  as  an  ‘arms  race’: Weapons 
may  become  more  numerous  or  effective  on  both  sides, 
but  neither  side  ultimately  benefits.

26. Experienced  animal  trainers 

take  a  stool  with  them 
when  they  step  into  a  cage  with  a  lion.  Why  a  stool? 
It  tames  a  lion  better  than  anything.  When  the  trainer 
holds  the  stool  with  the  legs  extended  toward  the 
lion’s  face,  the  animal  tries  to  focus  on  all  four  legs 
at  once,  and  that  paralyzes  him.  Divided  focus  always 
works  against  you.  Ernest  Hemingway  notes,  “We 
cannot  travel  every  path.  Success  must  be  won  along 
one  line.  We  must  make  our  business  the  one  life 
purpose  to  which  every  other  must  be  secondary.”

The  velocity  of  a  river  is  reduced  when  it  enters  a  large

When  you  touch  a  pencil  with  all  five  fingertips  with  your 
eyes  closed,  why  do  you  perceive  a  single  pencil  image

is  that  your  brain  has  special  circuits  that  help  you  build 
complete  pictures  from  individual  pieces  of  information.

I  have  a  small  machine  shop.  For  a  long  time  business 
was  really  slow.  We  once  went  weeks  without  any  new 
orders.  It  was  difficult  for  us  especially  since  some  of 
the  other  shops  in  our  area  were  really  busy.  But  then 
one  day  we  got  a  small  order.  Then  the  following  week 
we  got  another.  Business  started  to  pick  up.  We  started 
to  get  orders  every  week.  Recently  I  got  an  offer  to  do  a 
really  big  job,  and  I  took  it  without  considering  how 
much  work  it  would  be.  But  I  wish  I  hadn’t  accepted  it 
because  now  we  have  too  much  to  do.

34. Since  a  basic  vocabulary  of  2,000  words,  the  core 
vocabulary,  plays  such  an  important  role  in  English, 
some  people  have  suggested 
that  acquiring  it  will 
allow  you 
to  understand  80  or  90  percent  of 
everything  that  you  hear  or  read  in  English.  In  fact, 
things  are  more  complicated  than  that.  What  actually 
happens  is  that  with  a  vocabulary  of  2,000  words,  you 
can  understand  everything  you  see  or  hear  a  lot  of 
the 
times  you  won’t  understand 
anything  at  all.  It  depends  on  what  kind  of  situation 
you  are  dealing  with.  The  core  vocabulary  will  allow 
you  to  deal  with  a  large  number  of  ordinary  everyday 
situations,  but  once  you

It  was  very  disturbing  reading  your  article  about  how  the 
farmers  plan  to  handle  the  wild  pig  overpopulation  on  the 
Channel  Islands.  Humans  always  seem  to  think  that  the 
best  way  to  deal  with  any  type  of  animal  problem  is  to 
just  kill  them.  Isn’t  there  another  alternative  than  shooting 
these  pigs?  Humans  brought  pigs  over  to  these  islands 
many  years  ago.  Now  that  they  have  overpopulated,  people 
want  to  murder  them.  Where  were  all  of  the  humans  when 
the  pigs  started  to  multiply  out  of  control?

32. Certain  discoveries  in  genetics,  in  brain  surgery,  and  in 
many  other  areas  can  be  misused  causing  great 
damage  to  humanity.  This  is  unavoidable  as  long  as 
industrial  and  military  organizations  are  free  to  make 
use  of  new  theoretical  discoveries.  These  organizations 
must  not  be  allowed  to  determine  the  application  of 
scientific  research.  This  will  require  a  control  board, 
whose  permission  would  be  necessary  for  the  practical 
application  of  any  new  theoretical  discovery.  Needless

33. Employers  may  not  accept  the  idea  of  telecommuting. 
They  may  feel  a  loss  of  control  over  employees  who 
work  at  home.  Besides,  employers  often  believe  that 
the  best  work  gets  done  when  people  work  with  other 
people.  Face-to-face  meetings  are  not  possible  with 
telecommuters.  Meetings  on  the  phone  are  not  the 
same.  The  subtle  message  of  body  language  gets  lost 
in  phone  conversations.  It  is  also  not  possible  to  solve 
problems  that  need  immediate  attention.  The  biggest 
problem,  in  fact,  may  be  trust.  Can  an  employer  trust

Wolf  spiders  are  a  group  of  ground-dwelling  hunting 
spiders.  There  are  more  than  2,000  types  of  wolf  spiders. 
Their  sizes  range  from  2 mm  to  40 mm.  Some  wolf  spiders 
can  even  walk  on  the  surface  of  a  pond.  They  use  their 
front  legs  to  catch  their  prey,  and  then  they  bite  and 
crush  the  prey.  Some  even  build  a  trapdoor  which  they 
hide  under,  then  when  their  prey  comes  on  the  trapdoor, 
they  jump  out  at  it.  When  the  spider  is  pregnant,  she 
attaches  the  egg  sac  to  herself,  then  she  tears  the  egg  sac 
open.  The  babies  crawl  onto  the  mother  and  stay  there 
for  about  one  week.

also  prove  to  be  glimpses  of  the  miraculous.  Each

Corporate  social  responsibility  means  that  a  corporation

Person  (B)   Thank  you  for  your  fair  and  well-written

excellent  education.  They  didn’t  have  computers  for  every

I  will  never  forget  the  feeling  I  had  when  Dad  said  to 
his  friend,  “I’d  love  to  go  to  the  restaurant  with  you,  but 
tonight  is  a  special  time  with  my  daughter.”  I  could  tell 
this  man  was  disappointed,  but  amazingly  to  me,  he 
seemed  to  understand.  Dad  and  I  did  everything  we  had 
planned  on  that  trip.  I  don’t  think  any  young  girl  ever 
loved  her  father  as  much  as  I  loved  mine  that  night.

When  I  was  11  years  old,  Dad  promised  to  take  me 
with  him  on  a  business  trip  to  San  Francisco.  I  was  so 
excited!  We  were  going  to  be  there  for  two  days,  and 
we  planned  everything.  Dad  was  going  to  be  busy  in 
meetings  the  first  day,  so  I  would  hang  around  the 
to  have  our 
hotel.  After  his  meetings,  we  planned 
favorite  Chinese  food.  Then  we’d  take  a  ride  on  a 
tourist  bus,  and  go  back  to  our  hotel  room  for  a  video 
and  chocolate  ice  cream.  I  was  dying  with  anticipation.

The  day  finally  arrived.  The  hours  dragged  by  as  I

Finally,  at  6:30,  he  arrived  with  another  man,  an 
influential  businessman.  I  remember  how  my  heart  sank 
as  this  man  asked  if  we  would  like  to  go  to  a  seafood 
restaurant  with  him.  Oh  no!  I  thought.  I  hate  fish  and  I’ll 
just  sit  there  while  Dad  and  his  friend  talk.  I  could  see 
all  my  hopes  and  plans  I  had  with  my  dad  being  ruined.
