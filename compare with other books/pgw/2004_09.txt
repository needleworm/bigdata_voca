They  were  born  out  of  the  habit  of  Korean  housewives 
of  making  good  use  of  small,  otherwise  useless,  pieces 

of  leftover  cloth.  They  are  easily  folded  and  take  up  little 

space.  So  they  have  become  a  part  of  everyday  Korean 
they  were  created  for 
customs  and  practices.  Although 

everyday  use,  they  have  added  style  to  special  occasions. 

A  typical  example  of  this  is  to  wrap  wedding  gifts.  They 
are  also  convenient  and  safe  when  used  to  carry  things.

Being  the  “brightest”  member  of  my  third  grade  class, 
I  was  asked  to  recite  a  rather  lengthy  poem  for  a  school 
event.  My  initial  response  to  the  task  was  “No  big  deal,” 
and  I  jumped  at  the  opportunity  to  be  in  the  spotlight  yet 
again.  I  casually  practiced  my  presentation  at  home. 
The  day  came.  I  began  to  recite  the  poem,  but  I  suddenly  lost 
my  memory  and  could  say  only  two  lines  before  I  dried  up. 

My  face  became  red  with  embarrassment  as  the  audience 

giggled  quietly  and  my  teacher  secretly  fed  me  my  lines.

possibility  of  the  end  of  human  life  itself.  We  may 
become  so  developed  that  we  kill  ourselves!  Therefore, 
the  most  recent  definition  of  development  emphasizes 
sustainable  development:  the  improvement  of  human 
quality  of  life  within  the  limits  of  a  green,  healthy 
earth. 
,  it  is  development  which  aims 
to  protect,  not  destroy,  the  earth’s  resources.  This  will

generations’  lifestyles.  They  will  also  be  able  to  get  fruits

Imagine  you  were  asked  to  work  overtime  and  you 
didn’t  want  to  do  it.  Then  you  were  told  you  would 
get  paid  twice  as  much  money.  You  would  probably 
become  more  cooperative.  This  idea  also  works  with 
children.  A  few  years  ago,  a  child  of  mine  wouldn’t 
brush  her  teeth  before  going  to  bed.  Nothing  we  did 
could  make  her  change  her  mind.  Then,  my  parenting 
class  teacher  recommended  that  I  should  give  her 
                 
.  So  I  used  this  simple  phrase,  which 
worked  wonders:  “If  you  go  and  brush  your  teeth  now, 
we  will  have  time  to  read  three  stories  instead  of  just 
one.”  Whenever  she  heard  it,  she  would  jump  up  and 
brush  her  teeth  right  away. [1점]

22. When  something  doesn’t  meet  our  expectations,  many 
of  us  operate  on  the  assumption,  “When  in  doubt,  it 
must  be  someone  else’s  fault.”  You  can  see  this 
assumption  in  action  almost  everywhere  you  look ― the 
car  isn’t  working  properly,  so  the  mechanic  must  have 
repaired 
incorrectly;  your  expenses  exceed  your 
income,  so  your  husband  or  wife  must  be  spending  too 
much  money.  However, 
takes  an  enormous 
amount  of  mental  energy.  It  makes  you  feel  powerless 
over  your  own  life,  because  your  happiness  depends 
on  the  behavior  of  others,  which  you  can’t  control.

24. Modern  art  includes  creations  that  can  never  be  collected, 
traditional  sense.  Often 
in 
the 
owned,  or  exhibited 
preferring  concepts  over  materials,  modern  artists 
.  As  a  result,  they  have  gone  beyond  the 
natural  environment.  Their  works  use  everything  from 
neon  lights  and  computers  to  the  artists’  own  bodies,  as 
artistic  mediums.  Artists  and  art  works  can  therefore 
become  identical,  as  in  the  case  of  Body  Art.  On  the 
other  hand,  they  can  be  distant  from  each  other.  For 
example,  an  artist  might  phone  workers 
in  a 
museum,  instructing  them  on  how  to  make  a  work 
that  he  has  not  seen  or  touched  himself.

① use  materials  in  the  broadest  sense
② break  the  ties  with  traditional  artists
③ express  their  ideas  without  using  technology
④ are  more  concerned  with  the  natural  environment
⑤ use  natural  materials  more  than  traditional  artists  did

    The  captain  of  a  luxury  liner  was  instructing  a  new 

crew  member  on  part  of  his  job.  “Your  responsibility, 
sailor,  in  case  of  danger,  is  to  yell  ‘Man  the  lifeboats! 
Man  the  lifeboats!’”  The  sailor  practiced  it  and  soon  had  it 
down  perfectly.  A  few  hours  later,  the  boat  was  hit  by 
an  iceberg  and  began  sinking.  The  sailor  yelled,  “Woman

On  the  first  day,  I  and  a  co-worker  went  into  the  store 
after  work.  Needless  to  say,  everything  looked  good.  The 
store  was  pretty  well  stocked.  We  both  took  mental  notes  of 

things  we’d  eventually  get.  We  wisely  decided  not  to  buy 
anything  on  that  day.  We  had  plenty  of  time.  We  walked 

around  leisurely,  eyeing  different  items.  I  said  to  myself, 

“Here  are  some  cheap  computer  games.  That  pair  of  roller 
too.  That  battery-powered 
blades  for  $25 

looks  good, 

electric  shaver  could  sure  come  in  handy.”  Yes,  we  were

day  of  the  sale,  when  the  prices  would  be  really  low.

Yesterday  I  ate  lunch  at  your  restaurant,  which  you

packed  with  people  that  the  line  snaked  out  the  door,  and 

by  the  time  I  reached  the  counter,  I  was  exhausted.  I  decided 

on  the  hamburger  steak  special  and  side  dishes,  but  there 
was  no  potato  salad  left  and  the  beans  were  burnt  more  than 

baked.  At  the  table,  the  truck  driver  sitting  across  from  me

I  rose  to  leave,  the  waiter  “kindly”  yelled  at  me  to  clean  up

tern 

The  arctic 

is  an  extraordinary  bird 

that  makes 
difficult  journeys.  It  flies  up  to  35,000  kilometers  every 
year ― all  around  the  world  from  the  North  Pole  to  the 
South  Pole  and  back  again!  That’s  more  than  any  other 
animal.  Arctic  terns  fly  through  all  types  of  weather,  using 

the  sun  and  stars  to  help  them.  They  spend  almost  all  of 

their  life  in  the  air.  When  they  need  food,  they  catch 
fish  from  the  sea.  Some  arctic  terns  live  thirty  years  or 
more ― so  they  travel  over  one  million  kilometers  in  their 

lifetime.  The  bird  is  only  thirty-eight  centimeters  long  and 

weighs  around  300  grams.

34. When  we  hear  about  wetlands  such  as  swamps  and  bogs, 
we  are  often  reminded  of  unpleasant  experiences:  we  get 
swamped  with  homework  and  bogged  down  in  math 
problems.  This  makes  it  hard  to  realize  the  importance  of 
wetlands.  Wetlands  are  important  to  many  kinds  of 
animals  and  plants  that  live  there.  Some  birds  nest  in 
wetlands  and  others  use  them  for  rest  stops  during  flights.

35. Nearly  two-thirds  of  the  world’s  population  live  under 
night  skies  polluted  by  light.  In  most  heavily  urbanized 
regions,  it  no  longer  really  gets  dark  because  of  street 
lamps,  security 
lights  and 
neon  signs.  In  a  natural  night  sky,  someone  looking  at 
the  heavens  with  the  unaided  eye  should  be  able  to  see 
nearly  3,500  stars  and  planets  and  the  glow  from  the 
Milky  Way,  our  home  galaxy.  But  in  large  cities,  the 
number  of  visible  stars  has  fallen  to  a  few  dozen.  This 
stunning  drop  has  made  it  impossible  to  grow  up  being 
exposed  to  the  natural  beauty  and  inspiration  of  the 
night  sky.

Chef  Walter  Potenza  owns  three  thriving  Italian  restaurants 
on  Rhode  Island.  He  believes  that  his  success  is  the  product 

of  lifetime  education.  “When  I  opened  my  first  restaurant,  all 

of  a  sudden,  my  schooling  and  my  knowledge  came  into 
play.  It  made  me  an  academic,  a  person  who  explored

Credit  card  misuse  remains  at  an  alarmingly  high  level. 

It  is  a  cause  not  only  of  personal  tragedies,  but  also  of 

more  serious  social  problems.  But  how  can  we  deal  with 
this  situation?  Whatever  solution  we  choose,  it  must  focus 

on  changing  consumers’  spending  habits  for  the  better. 

Up  to  now,  people  have  been  encouraged  to  use  credit 
cards  for  various  reasons.  This  was  good  for  those  who 

used  their  cards  wisely,  but  many  have  taken  on  large 

debts  as  a  result.  Now  is  the  time,  therefore,  to  emphasize 
sensible  individual  credit  card  use.  Various  financial  support 

programs  can  be  helpful  in  this,  but  unless  consumers 

spend  within  their  means,  there  can  be  no  solution.

In  recent  years,  we’ve  been  dreaming  very  different 
dreams.  The  stuff  of  these  dreams  is  fantasy ― swords 
and  wizards,  knights  and 
ladies.  The  business  of  
fantasy  has  become  a  multibillion-dollar  reality,  and 
science  fiction  is  starting  to  feel  old-fashioned.  Our 
fascination  with  science  fiction  reflected  a  deep  faith 
that  technology  would  lead  us  to  a  cyber  utopia,  with 

robot  servants  serving  food.  But 
in  fact,  a  dark, 
pessimistic  attitude  toward  technology  and  the  future  is 
attracting  more  and  more  people.  And  the  evidence  is 
the  world’s  new  concern  with  a  nostalgic,  magical 

vision  of 
electricity;  villages,  not  cities;  the  past,  not  the  future.

Every  human  being  will  grow  older  and  die.  Aging  in  itself 

is  not  a  disease  or  a  sickness,  but  as  people  age,  disease 

often  follows  and  the  elderly  need  others’  help.  In  addition, 
the  percentage  of  senior  citizens  in  the  world  has  increased 

very  quickly,  and  our  society  is  no  exception.  The  problem 

for  us  is  that  we  have  left  the  care  of  the  elderly  to  their 
families.  We  must  change  our  attitude  toward  this  issue  and 

develop  more  systematic  social  programs.  The  sooner  we 

realize  the  importance  of  the  role  of  government  in  this 
matter,  the  smaller  the  final  cost  to  society  as  a  whole  will  be.

The  boomerang,  a  light,  thin,  and  well-balanced  missile, 
was  the  very  first  Australian  invention.  ① It  could  be  thrown 
into  the  air  to  imitate  a  hawk,  causing  birds  to  get  frightened 
and  fly  into  nets  where  they  were  caught.  ② However, 
boomerangs  were  mostly  used  in  competitions  between 
native  tribes.  ③ The  idea  was  to  see  who  could  make  the 
boomerang  do  the  most  circles  in  flight  before  it  returned  to 
the  thrower’s  feet.  ④ The  birds  caught  by  the  boomerang

When  I  entered  the  ninth  grade,  I  thought  I  would  have 
to  work  very  hard,  and  my  teachers  would  be  very  strict. 
So  when  the  history  teacher  told  us  what  we  were  going 

to  study,  I  became  confused  and  tired.  I  stumbled  into 
the  English  class,  my  head  still  spinning.  The  first  thing 
the  English  teacher  did  was  to  pass  around  a  tea  bag.  She 
said,  “I  was  making  my  usual  cup  of  tea  this  morning, 
and  I  found  this  strange  tea  bag.  It  smells  of  tea,  and  it 
looks  the  same  as  all  the  other  tea  bags  in  the  box,  but 
there  is  nothing  inside  it.  I’d  like  you  to  write  something, 
using  this  as  a  metaphor.”　We  got  into  it  right  away  and 
came  up  with  some  really  cool  ideas.  The  teacher  said 
tea  bags  bring  good  luck,  so  she  hung  this  one  above  her 
desk.  After  we  had  all  survived  that  first  day,  we  built  an 

even  better  relationship  with  the  teacher,  and  we  learned 

a  lot.  And  whenever  I  felt  particularly  stressed,  angry  or 
sad,  I  would  go  sit  under  the  tea  bag  and  talk  to  her.  She 

was  definitely                              .

These  experiences  have  taught  me  that  change,  which 

is  an  essential  part  of  our  life,  can  have  both  positive 

and  negative  effects.  It  may  hurt  us  a  little  when  it 
occurs,  but  if  we  accept  it  as  a  growth  process,  it  will 

bring  benefits  in  the  long  run.  My  best  advice  is  to  “go 

with  the  flow.”  Keep  an  open  mind  and  be  optimistic. 

Change  happens  to  us  all  at  some  point  in  our  life. 

I  am  no  exception.  When  I  was  young,  I  went  through 

serious  growing  pains.  My  ankles  and  knees  ached  at 
night.  It  hurt,  and  it  was  a  little  scary.  My  mother  told 
me  that  it  had  something  to  do  with  “growth  plates.” 

She  explained  that  I  should  accept  the  aches  and  pains 
gladly  because  they  meant  that  I  was  growing  fast. 

When  other  painful  changes  came  along  in  later  life, 
I  always  recalled  my  mother’s  words.  And  recently, 

when  a  friend  of  mine  was  having  a  hard  time  dealing 
with  the  loss  of  his  job,  I  gave  him  the  same  advice.  At 
first  he  couldn’t  accept  it,  but  after  a  while,  he  came  to 
see  that  this  was  one  of  the  changes  that  happen  to 
everyone.  In  the  end,  losing  a  job  motivated  him  to  start 
his  own  business.

Bill:  School  education  should  include  the  skills  needed 

in  adult  life  as  well  as  the  study  of  knowledge  and 
information.  Sports  develop  such  skills  by  showing 

students  how  to  keep  fit,  how  to  work  in  a  team, 

and  how  to  practice  self-discipline.  Children  who 
in 
haven’t  been  given 

the  chance 

take  part 

to 

physical  activities  can  lose  out  on  social  skills  when 

they  get  older.  On  the  other  hand,  if  forced  to  take 
part  in  sports  in  school,  they  may  well  discover 

hidden  talents.  Many  famous  sports  people  started 

their  careers  in  this  way.  Given  this  fact,  everybody 
should  take  a  sports  class  in  school.

Sue:  Important  social  skills  can  be  achieved  through  other 

activities,  such  as  charity  work  for  old  people, 
instead  of  sports  classes.  When  something  is  forced, 
the  benefits  it  may  bring  are  destroyed.  After  all, 
you  can  take  a  horse  to  water,  but  you  can’t  make 
it  drink.  Taking  part  in  a  sports  class  should  therefore 
be  a  matter  of  free  choice  for  the  students,  although 
encouraged  by  the  school.
