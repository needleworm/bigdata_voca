This  refers  to  a  kind  of  building  for  sheltering  animals, 
their  feed,  farm  supplies,  farm  machinery,  and  farm 
products.  Sometimes  this  is  used  for  storing  hay  and  grain, 
too.  The  need  for  this  has  declined  with  the  introduction  of 
tractors  and  electrical  services.  Traditionally,  wood  was  used 
in  constructing  this,  but  sheet  steel  and  aluminum  have 
been  increasingly  used  since  World  War  II,  particularly  on 
large  farms  in  North  American  and  European  countries. 
This  usually  consists  of  two  stories,  the  first  to  shelter 
animals  or  machines  and  the  second  to  store  hay  or  grain.

Whether  woven  or  printed,  a  fine  tie  is  a  work  of  art 
from  beginning  to  end.  Woven  silk  ties  are  the  most 
luxurious  of  all.  Though  less  common  today,  ① they

were  at  one 
gentleman.  Because  of  ② their  high  manufacturing  cost, 
woven  silk  ties  are  very  expensive.  This  in  part  accounts 
for  the  fact  that  ③ they  now  represent  only  five  percent 
of  tie  production.  But  ④ they  will  never  fall  entirely  by 
the  wayside  and  will  make  periodic  comebacks.  Printed 
silk  ties  are  much  cheaper  and  simpler  than  ⑤ their 
woven  counterparts.  However,  silk  printing  demands  a 
high  level  of  technical  mastery.

Although  most  people  use  the  bus  or  subway  to  get 
around  Seoul,  every  once  in  a  while  it’s  nice  to  spend  a 
sunny  day  crossing  the  city  on  a  bicycle.  While  riding, 
you  are  certain  to  discover  new  streets  and  different 
views  of  the  capital.  “The  key  to  enjoying  cycling  is  to 
choose  the  right  streets,”  says  one  city  official,  adding 
that  alleys  off  main  roads  can  be  interesting  areas  to 
explore.  If  you  only  ride  occasionally,  you  don’t  have  to 
spend  a  lot  of  money  because  bikes  can  be  rented.  Let’s 
discover  Seoul  and  learn  about  its  undiscovered  back 
streets  on  a  bike.

The  bodies  of  flowing  ice  we  call  glaciers  ① are  the 
most  spectacular  of  natural  features.  They  result  from 
densely  packed  snow.  Unlike  a  stream,  a  glacier  cannot 
seen  ② move.  Accurate  measurements,  however,   
be 
show  that  it  is  flowing.  Erosion  of  bedrock  by  glaciers 
and  deposits  of  the  eroded  materials  are  characteristic  and 
③ easily  recognizable.  Their  distribution  enables  us  to 
infer  that  in  the  recent  past  glaciers  have  been  far  more 
extensive  ④ than  they  are  today.  At  the  same  time,  this 
evidence  has  ⑤ raised  the  problem  of  the  cause  of  the 
‘ice  ages.’

When  drawing  human  figures,  children  often  make  the 
head  too  large  for  the  rest  of  the  body.  A  recent  study 
in 
offers  some 
children’s  drawings.  ① As  part  of  the  study,  researchers 
asked  children  between  four  and  seven  years  old  to  make 
several  drawings  of  adults.  ② When 
they  drew  frontal 
views  of  the  adults,  the  size  of  the  heads  was  markedly 
enlarged.  ③ Adults  tended  to  draw  children’s  faces  larger 
than  their  own.  ④ However,  when  the  children  drew  rear 
views  of  the  adults,  the  size  of  the  heads  was  not  nearly 
so  exaggerated.  ⑤ The  researchers  suggest  that  children 
draw  bigger  heads  when  they  know  that  they  must  leave 
space  for  facial  details.

24. Often  the  best  form  of  communication  with  friends  is, 
surprisingly,  ____________.  Friendship  is  not  only  about 
what  we  say,  but  even  more  importantly  about  what  we 
is 
do  not.  True  friendship  occurs  when  ‘information’ 
conveyed  by  absences  of  words.  The  point  is  to  convey  as 
lines.’  The 
much  as  possible 
reason  such  ‘negative’  communication  is  important  is  that 
it  requires  a  greater  closeness  than  positive  communication. 
The  greater  the  distance  between  sender  and  receiver,  the 
more  the  need  for  directness.  Only  when  two  or  more 
people  share  an  enormous  amount  can  the  much  more 
economical  negative  communication  take  place.

25. Team  performance  is  not  possible  if  the  leader  grabs  all 
the  best  chances,  assignments  and  credit  for  himself  or 
herself.  Indeed,  the  crucial  point  of  the  leader’s  challenge  is 
to  _________________________________.  When  the  Dollus 
Bank  team  leader  Trevor  Canfield  made  room  for  a  junior 
investment  banker  to  lead  a  prestigious  account,  he  did  just 
that.  So  did  Mike  Fangos  at  Gopak,  when  he  encouraged  a 
chemical  engineer  who  “could  not  balance  his  checkbook  at 
home”  to  take  responsibility  for  preparing  the  Zebra  Team’s 
$200  million  budget.  Stepping  out  of  the  way  to  give 
opportunities  to  others,  however,  does  not  mean  giving  up 
responsibility  for  guidance,  monitoring,  and  control.  [3점]

26. Michel  de  Montaigne, 

the  sixteenth-century  French 

fruitful  and  natural  exercise  of  our  mind 

essayist,  loved  conversation.  “To  my  taste,”  he  says,  “the 
most 
is 
conversation.  I  find  the  practice  of  it  the  most  delightful 
activity  in  our  lives.”  According  to  Montaigne,  “studying 
books 
is  a  weak  mental  activity,  while  conversation 
provides  teaching  and  excercise  all  at  once.”  Montaigne 
thinks  of  conversation  as  ______________________  that 
will  improve  his  mind.  “If  I  am  fighting  with  a  strong 
and  solid  opponent,  he  will  attack  me;  his  ideas  send 
mine  soaring.  Rivalry,  competitiveness  and  glory  will 
drive  me  and  raise  me  above  my  own  level.  Our  mind  is 
strengthened  by  contact  with  dynamic  and  well-ordered 
minds.”

27. Studies  regarding  our  habits  of  eating  out  found  that, 
when  we  eat  out,  we  tend  to  underestimate  the  number  of 
calories  we  consume  by  up  to  half.  When  we  eat  in  a 
relaxing,  candle-lit  restaurant,  we  tend  to  enjoy  our  food 
longer  even 
if  we  are  full.  Dining  with  friends  also 
contributes  to  consuming  more  calories.  Researchers  found 
that  women  who  dined  with  two  or  three  friends  ate  700 
calories  on  average,  double 
that  of  solo  diners.  Our 
psychology  is  another  factor  in  the  consumption  of  calories. 
A  waiter  who  greeted  customers  with  the  question,  “What 
are  we  celebrating 
tonight?”  _______________________ 
than  waiters  who  didn’t.  Therefore,  if  you  treat  dining  as  a 
special  occasion,  you’re  more  likely  to  eat  more.

When  a  ballet  dancer  leaps  across  the  stage  in  a  grand 
jump,  her  center  of  mass  faithfully  follows  a  parabolic 
path  during  the  jump.  The  distance  between  the  top  of 
her  head  and  her  center  of  mass  ① changes  depending 
upon  the  movements  of  her  legs.  When  she  ② stretches 
her  legs  out  horizontally  after  her  feet  leave  the  stage,  her 
center  of  mass  moves  upward.  It  results  in  an  ③ increase 
in  the  distance  between  the  top  of  her  head  and  her 
center  of  mass.  In  contrast,  when  the  dancer  ④ lowers  her 
legs  toward  the  ground,  the  opposite  occurs.  The  height  of 
the  top  of  her  head  remains  ⑤ constant  throughout  the 
jump.  The  result  gives  the  impression  that  the  dancer  is
drifting  through  the  air.

Henry  was  moving  the  soccer  ball  down 

the  field 
thrilled  with  the  prospect  of  scoring  a  goal−the  first  in 
his  entire  life.  In  his  haste,  he  didn’t  realize  that  his 
teammates  weren’t  anywhere  near  him.  Concentrating, 
filled  with  expectation,  he  sped  eagerly  toward  the  goal. 
It  wasn’t  until  the  last  second  that  he  noticed  who  the 
goalkeeper  was−his  teammate!  It  was  too  late,  however, 
as  Henry’s  foot  had  already  begun  moving  to  kick  the 
ball  into  the  net.  A  perfect  kick!  Then  total  silence! 
Henry  realized  that  he  had  made  a  terrible  mistake.  He 
had  scored  for  the  opposing  team.  Henry  glanced  at  his 
coach  who  looked  furious  as  he  screamed  at  him.  He 
wanted  the  earth  to  swallow  him  up.

Children  grow  up  and 

leave  home.  They  go  from 
helpless  babies  to  mature  adults  while  our  back  is  turned. 
The  secret  is  to  try  and  keep  pace  with  them.  We  have  to 
resist  the  urge  to  do  everything  for  them,  and  let  them  fry 
eggs  or  paint  trash  cans  for  themselves.  By  the  time  they 
reach  adolescence,  we  may  expect  them  to  be  able  to  keep 
their  room  tidy  for  the  first  time.  But  they  have  never 
done  it  before.  They  have  to  learn  how  to  do  it,  and  part

33. Many  years  ago,  my  drama  director,  frustrated  with 
my  bad  acting  in  a  play,  shouted,  “No!  No!  Your  body 
is  contradicting  your  words.  Every  tiny  movement  reveals 
your  private  thoughts.”  Then  he  said  something  I’ll  never 
forget:  “The  way  you  move  is  your  autobiography  in 
motion.”  How  right  he  was!  On  the  stage  of  real  life, 
every  physical  move  you  make  subconsciously 
tells 
everyone  the  story  of  your  life.  As  dogs  hear  sounds  our 
ears  can’t  detect,  people  make  and  notice  moves  that  are 
beneath  human  consciousness  but  have  tremendous  power 
to  attract  or  offend.

34. Science  is  all  about  trying  ideas,  abandoning  those  that 
don’t  work,  and  building  on  those  that  do.  It  never  stops. 
Those  people  in  the  past  who  had  wrong  ideas  weren’t 
fools.  They  were  doing  the  best  they  could,  given  the 
knowledge  of  their  times.  We  do  the  same  thing  today. 
And  you  can  be  sure  that  people  in  the  future  will  look 
back  and  wonder  why  we  believe  some  of  the  things  we 
do.  Does  that  make  science  unimportant?  If  some  of  our 
scientific  theories  are  going  to  be  proved  false,  why 
bother  studying  them?  If  you  believe  something  is  an 
absolute  truth,  you  can  just  memorize  it  and  get  on  with 
your  life.  After  all,  there  is  always  something  to  explore 
in  the  world.

were  the  three  most  common  sources  of  advice  for  all 
age  groups,  although  their  relative  importance  varied  with 
age.  ② As  age  increased,  friends  progressively  became  a 
important  source  of  advice,  while  parents  and 
more

to  14  turned  more  often  to  parents  than  friends  for 
advice.  ④ For  young  Australians  aged  from  15  to  19, 
friends  was  the  biggest  source  of  advice,  followed  by 
parents.  ⑤ For 
their

The  result  is  that  the  population  enters  a  period  of 
rapid  growth.

There  is  an  interesting  relationship  between  a  country’s 
developmental  progress  and  its  population  structure.  (　①　) 
According  to  the  theory  of  demographic  transition,  nations 
go  through  several  developmental  stages.  (　 ②　 )  The 
earliest  stage  is  characterized  by  high  birth  and  death 
rates  and  slow  growth.  (　 ③　 )　 As  they  begin  to 
develop,  the  birth  rate  remains  high,  but  the  death  rate  falls. 
(　④　)    Then,  as  industrialization  peaks,  the  birth  rate 
falls  and  begins  to  approximate  the  death  rate.  (　⑤　) 
Eventually,  population  growth  slows  drastically,  reaching 
a  stage  of  very  modest  growth  which  is  seen  in  many 
European  nations  today.

37. “What 

is 

to 

is  value 

the  customer?” 

the  most 
important  question  in  business,  yet  is  rarely  asked.  One 
reason  is  that  managers  are  quite  sure  that  they  know  the 
answer.  Value  is  what  they,  in  their  business,  define  as 
quality.  But  this  is  almost  always  the  wrong  definition. 
The  customer  never  buys  a  product  but  the  satisfaction  of 
a  want.  For  the  teenage  girl,  for  instance,  value  in  a  shoe 
is  high  fashion.  Price  is  a  secondary  consideration  and 
durability  is  not  value  at  all.  For  the  same  girl  as  a 
young  mother,  a  few  years  later,  what  she  looks  for  is 
durability,  price  and  comfort.

38. By  thinking  the  right  thoughts,  you  can  make  any  job 
to  be  more 
less  distasteful.  Your  boss  wants  you 
interested  in  your  job  so  that  he  or  she  will  make  more 
money.  But  let’s  forget  about  what  the  boss  wants.  Think 
only  of  what  getting  interested  in  your  job  will  do  for 
you.  Remind  yourself  that  it  may  double  the  amount  of 
happiness  you  get  out  of  life,  for  you  spend  about  one 
half  of  your  waking  hours  at  work.  Keep  reminding 
yourself  that  getting  interested  in  your  job  will  take  your 
mind  off  your  worries,  and  in  the  long  run,  will  probably 
bring  about  promotion  and  increased  pay.  Even  if  it 
doesn’t  do  that,  it  will  reduce  fatigue  to  a  minimum  and 
help  you  enjoy  your  hours  of  leisure.

39. artificial  skin에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?

A  group  of  researchers  have  recently  developed  an 
artificial  skin  that  can  detect  both  pressure  and  temperature 
at  the  same  time.  They  inserted  pressure  sensors  and 
temperature  sensors  in  a  thin  plastic  film  to  create  a 
net-like  structure.  The  new  artificial  skin  is  flexible  enough 
to  wrap  around  robot  fingers  and  relatively  inexpensive  to 
make.  This  breakthrough  has  the  potential  to  improve  how 
robots  will  function  in  the  real  world.  Future  artificial  skins 
could 
incorporate  sensors  not  only  for  pressure  and 
temperature,  but  also  for  light,  humidity,  strain  or  sound.

to  use  a  pedestrian

hand,  red  foxes  are  sometimes  extremely  careless.  They 
often  come  running  in  response  to  an  imitation  of  their 
bark,  regardless  of  danger.  They  readily  return  to  areas 
where  they  have  been  heavily  hunted  in  the  past.  So 
whether  or  not  the  red  fox  is  especially  intelligent  is  an 
open  question.

41. Sleep  recharges  our  brains  and  helps  us  think  more

cells  in  a  hiker’s  leg,  or  young  yeast  cells  turning  a  tank 
of  grape  juice  into  wine.  Regardless  of  type,  however,  no 
cell  can  ‘make’  energy.  Energy  can  neither  be  created  nor 
destroyed,  but  can  merely  be  transformed  from  one  state 
to  another.  Each  cell  must  therefore  obtain  its  energy 
from  some  outside  environmental  source,  and  cells  do  so 
in  a  range  of  ways.  Yeast  cells  growing  on  a  grape  skin 
obtain  energy  from  nutrient  molecules  originally  processed

    When  a  basketball  team  finds  itself  on  the  wrong 
side  of  momentum,  or  when  its  opponent  has  gained 
the  advantage,  the  coach  calls  for  a  timeout.

(A) Likewise,  we  must  occasionally  call  timeout.  In  the 
cycles  of  life  and  business  we  have  times  when  we 
must  break  the  rhythm  of  failure  and  loss.  During 
this  break  in  the  action  we  must  determine  what  is 
working  and  what  is  not.

increase  the  team’s  confidence  and  break  its  downward

① 나는 스페인어 수업을 좋아하게 되었다.

My  freshman  year  flew  by.  Your  Spanish  class  quickly 
became  my  favorite  class.  You  taught  us  through  arts  and 
crafts,  music,  and  pictures.  All  of  your  classes  were 
incredibly  visually  stimulating.  Your  classes  were  just 
unusual  enough  to  be  completely  memorable.  Before  I 
knew  it,  I  found  myself  looking  forward  to  your  class, 
which  was  the  last  period  of  the  day.  I  barely  realized 
the  180th  day  had  arrived.  I  had  done  well 
that 
throughout 
learned  a 
reasonable  amount  of  new  information,  but  that  certainly 
didn’t  mean  that  I  understood  Spanish.  You  still  had  to

something 
together 
had

that  everyone  else  had  also  understood.  The  feeling  of 
pride  and  accomplishment 
that  came  over  me  was 
incredible,  and  it  is  something  that  I  will  never  forget.

On  the  first  day  of  Spanish  class,  you  read  us  a 
paragraph  in  a  language  that  we  knew  nothing  about, 
and  I  didn’t  understand  a  word  of  it.  From  the  panicked 
faces  I  saw  around  the  room,  none  of  my  classmates 
did  either.  You  promised  us  that  on  the  last  day  of 
class  when  you  reread  it,  we  would  understand.  I  rolled 
my  eyes,  knowing  that  there  was  no  way  I  would  be 
able  to  comprehend  something  so  foreign  by  June.  I 
gave  you  180  days  to  prove  me  wrong,  but  remained 
content  in  knowing  that  you  wouldn’t  be  able  to  do  it.

Mel,  a  chimpanzee  in  Gombe,  Nigeria,  was  three  years 
old  when  his  mother  died.  He  had  no  elder  brother  or 
sister  to  adopt  him.  To  our  amazement,  he  was  adopted 
twelve-year-old  chimpanzee,  Spindle,  who  was 
by  a 
certainly  not  related  to  Mel.  As  weeks  passed,  the  two 
became        (A)      .  Spindle  took  care  of  Mel  while 
traveling;  he  permitted  (a) the  infant  to  ride  on  his  back, 
even  allowed  him  to  hang  beneath,  as  a  mother  carries 
her  baby.  Most  remarkably,  if  Mel  got  too  close  to  the  big 
males,  Spindle  would  hurry  to  remove  (b) his  small  charge 
from  danger  even  though  this  meant  he  got  into  trouble 
himself. 

For  a  whole  year,  this  relationship  endured,  and  there 
was  no  doubt  that  Spindle  saved  Mel’s  life.  Why  did 
Spindle  act  that  way,  burdening  himself  with  the  care  of 
(c) a  sickly  youngster?  Probably  we  shall  never  know, 
but  it  is  interesting  to  reflect  that  during  the  plague 
that  claimed  Mel’s  mother,  Spindle’s  mother  also 
died.  Is  it  possible  that  Spindle’s  loss  of  his  mother 
left  an  empty  space  in  his  life?  And  that  the  contact 
with  (d) a  dependent  baby  helped  to  fill  that  space?  Or 
did  Spindle  experience  an  emotion  similar  to  that  which 
we  call
(B)      ?  Perhaps  (e) the  lonely  chimpanzee 
felt  a  mixture  of  both.
