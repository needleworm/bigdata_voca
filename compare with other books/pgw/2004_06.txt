    It’s  frustrating.  You’re  excited  about  the  work  you’ve 
just  completed  on  your  computer.  You  start  to  print.  And 
suddenly  it  happens.  You  run  out  of  ink.  To  make  matters 
worse,  when  you  take  the  empty  color  cartridge  out  of  the 
printer  and  shake 
inside. 
Although  only  one  color  has  run  dry,  the  whole  cartridge 
ink 
is  now  useless.  Obviously, 
translates  into  wasted  money.  Well,  the  good  news  is  that 
we  recently  introduced  a  system  whereby  each  color  is 
separated  into  individual  ink  tanks.  They’re  called  “Eco 
Tanks”  and  they  dramatically  reduce  a  printer’s  running 
costs.

    John  Brown,  the  hero  of  an  American  Negro  folk  song, 
was  born  in  1800  in  Connecticut,  USA.  His  father  was 
against  slavery  and  an  agent  of  the  Underground  Railroad, 
which  secretly  helped  runaway  slaves  to  reach  Canada.  At 
that  time,  slavery  was  a  usual  thing  in  the  southern  states 
of  America.  Slaves  could  be  bought  on  the  open  market 
and  sold  again.  Husbands  and  wives,  mothers  and  children 
were  sold  to  different  masters.  John  was  only  nine  years 
old  when  he  saw  a  black  slave  beaten  to  death.  He 
couldn’t  understand  why  black  people  were  treated  unfairly. 
He  decided  to  do  the  same  thing  as  his  father.

21. We  are  trained  to  control  bad  feelings  such  as  anger 

or  sorrow  in  public  and  to  think  before  we  act  on  them. 

That  doesn’t  necessarily  mean  we  should  make  this  kind 
of  control  a  habit  in  our  personal  lives.  My  advice? 

Unexpressed  feelings  are  harmful.  If  you’re  not  alone, 

simply  postpone 
them  for  a  few  moments.  Then  go 
somewhere  private  and  do  whatever  the  feeling  seems  to 

want  you  to  do.  Cry,  tremble,  or  shake  your  fists.  In 
short,

is  good  for  your  mental  health.

① living  in  privacy
② getting  some  rest
③ expressing  feelings
④ forming  good  habits
⑤ chatting  with  others

22. Your  blood  should  normally  contain  a  certain  amount 

of  water  and  salt.  This  is  also  true  of  the  tissues.  Now, 

suppose  this  balance  is  upset  for  some  reason  such  as  a 
long  hike.  Then,  your  blood  draws  water  from 
the 
its  balance 
tissues  of  your  body 
the 
constant.  As 

is  being  removed 

the  water 

in  order 

to  keep 

from 

tissues,  it  registers  in  your  brain.  The  brain  sends  a 
signal  to  the  throat,  making  it  contract.  This  contraction 

makes  you                     .  [2점]
*tissue: 신체조직

① fall  asleep                 
③ become  hungry       
⑤ stretch  your  body

② start  to  yawn

slips  of 

the 

tongue.  He  was  a 

teacher  at  Oxford 

University  and  a  clergyman  as  well.  Dr.  Spooner  suffered 

from  nervousness  and  poor  eyesight.  This  may  have  made 

it  difficult  for  him  to  see  words  correctly  and  to  repeat 

them  accurately.  One  time  he  told  a  student  that  he  had 

“hissed 

the  mystery 

lectures”  when  he  meant 

to  say 

“missed  the  history  lectures.”  He  told  another  student  that 

the  young  man  had  “tasted  a  worm.”  He  meant  to  say  that 

the  student  had  “wasted  a  term.”  Today,  this  particular 

type  of

is  often  called  a  “Spoonerism.”

① bad  behavior

③ teaching  method
⑤ learning  strategy

② table  manners

④ pronunciation  error

24. The  last  time  I  went  out  for  breakfast,  I  had  to  choose 

among  ten  types  of  pancakes,  six  varieties  of  juice,  and 

four  kinds  of  potatoes.  To  my  surprise,  my  wife  and 

children  love  all  this.  They  love  going  into  an  ice  cream 

shop  and  being  able  to  choose  among  seventy-five  flavors 

of  ice  cream  and  seventy-five  flavors  of  topping  to  put 

on  them.  For  my  part,  I  increasingly  find  that  I  miss 

   

            .  Faced  with  a  glass  case  filled  with  eighteen 

types  of  coffee,  I  just  wish  for  a  nice  cup  of  tea.  I’m 

afraid  I  am  the  only  person  in  the  house  who  feels  that 

way. 

①  simplicity   
④  harmony     

②  originality
⑤  imagination

③  curiosity

25. Some  history 

researchers 

suggest  Marco  Polo

.  Why  do  they  say  that?  First,  they  ask  why 

he  didn’t  write  about  the  Great  Wall.  It’s  hard  to  miss! 

Then,  they  point  out  he  also  failed  to  mention  Chinese 

tea-drinking  ceremonies,  a  very 

important  part  of 

life 

there.  Moreover,  no  Chinese  sources  of 

the  period 

mention  Marco  Polo,  although 

they  mention  other 

foreigners.  Finally,  some  say  he  never 

traveled  much 

farther  than  Turkey.  Travelers  who  tried  to  follow  his 

route  always  became  lost  at  this  point.  Perhaps  he  copied 

details  from  guidebooks  on  China.  [2점]

① was  interested  in  religion

② never  actually  visited  China

26. Glittering  gems  called  diamonds  are  among  the  most 
precious  of  human  possessions.  Through  the  ages,  they 
have  been  a  lasting  evidence  of  wealth.  Lands  may  lose 
their  soil,  buildings  may  be  destroyed,  stocks  and  bonds 
may  become  worthless,  but 
the  value  of  diamonds 
remains  relatively  unchanged.                   ,  the  diamond  is 
the  hardest  substance  ever  known.  Because  of  this,  it  is  of 
great  value  for  practical  use.  In  fact,  about  three-fourths  of 
the  total  annual  supply  of  diamonds  is  used  in  factories 
and  machine  shops.  [2점]

    John  Williams  is  famous  for  his  ability  to  write  powerful 
and  highly  effective  music  for  movies.  Mr.  Williams 

has  been  writing  music  for  movies  since  1960,  but  he  is 

perhaps  best  known  for  his  award-winning  scores  for  movies 
such  as  Jaws,  Star  Wars,  and  Schindler’s  List.  Before  he 

began  writing  music  for  the  movies,  Mr.  Williams  dreamed 

of  being  a  concert  pianist.  During  the  1950s,  Mr.  Williams 
was  into  jazz  and  he  worked  in  New  York  with  many 

jazz  artists.  Later,  he  moved  to  Los  Angeles  and  got  a  job 

writing  music  for  television  shows.  It  was  this  television 
job  which  led  him  into  movies.

    My  job  requires  me  to  bring  work  home.  I  need  a  work 
area  where  I  can  concentrate.  When  I  try  to  work,  my 
wife  is  always  there  with  a  steady  stream  of  questions  or 
small  talk.  When  I  sit  down  to  read,  I  read  only  for  a 
few  minutes  because  she  interrupts  me.  Even  when  she 
isn’t  in  the  room,  I  can  hear  her  talking,  yelling  or 
complaining  in  a  tone  that  can’t  be  ignored.  I  suppose  I 
should  feel  grateful  that  she  wants  to  talk  to  me.  But  the 
truth  is,  I  need  my  peace  and  quiet.  I  have  tried  to  discuss 
this  with  her,  but  it  only  upsets  her.

    As  we  drove  home,  Dad  did  not  say  a  word.  With  both 
hands  on  the  wheel,  he  stared  at  the  dirt  road.  My  older 
brother,  Robert,  was  also  silent.  He  leaned  his  head  back 
and  closed  his  eyes.  When  I  opened  the  front  door  to  the 
hut,  I  stopped.  Everything  we  owned  was  packed 
in 
cardboard  boxes.  I  sat  down  on  a  box.  The  thought  of 
having  to  move  to  an  unfamiliar  city  brought  tears  to  my 
eyes.  That  night  I  could  not  sleep,  thinking  about  how 
much  I  hated  this  move.

    What 
that 
technology  has  an  important  effect  on  our  lives.  But  to 
suggest  that  it  determines  how  we  live  can  easily  be 
shown  to  be  wrong.  If  you  are  given  a  computer,  you  can 
send  harmful  messages  to  other  people,  but  you  don’t  have

to  the  earth.  It  is  the  moon  that  has  the  greatest  effect  on 
the  tides.  The  sun  also  influences  the  tides.  However,  it  is 
so  far  away  that  it  has  less  than  half  the  pull  of  the

    Is  it  possible  to  measure  beauty?  ( ① )  Well,  the  ancient 
Greeks  believed  that  all  beauty  could  be  explained  with 
math  and  used  a  system  to  find  what  they  called  the 
“Golden  Ratio.”  ( ② )  They  found  it  by  drawing  lines

Yet  in  spite  of  the  advantages  mentioned  above,  the  use 

of  GM  crops 
is  causing  debates  among  scientists. 
Research  has  discovered  that  GM  crops  were  harming   

butterflies,  and  also  that  GM  food  slowed  growth  and 

increased  disease  in  rats.  Resistance  to  GM  foods  around 
the  world  is  growing. 

In  July  2001, 

the  European  Union  passed  a 

law 

requiring  all  food  products  from  GM  crops  to  be  clearly 

marked.  Many  countries  have  stopped  further  planting 
there  are  more  health  checks.  Moreover,  public 
until 

concern  is  so  great  in  some  countries  that  food  companies 

are  ending  the  use  of  GM  crops  altogether.  So,  people 
around  the  world  are  starting  to  ask  the  question:  Just

With  the  global  population  expected  to  rise  to  9  billion 
within  50  years,  GM  technology  is  giving  hope  to  people 

around  the  world.  They  think  GM  crops  can  offer  bigger 

harvests,  better  quality,  and  less  need  for  spraying  poisons 
to  kill  insects.  Not  surprisingly,  the  use  of  GM  seeds  has 
quickly  become  popular  among  farmers.  More  than  fifty 
percent  of  all  crops  planted  in  the  U.S.  are  from  GM 
seeds,  including  tomatoes,  corn,  and  potatoes.
