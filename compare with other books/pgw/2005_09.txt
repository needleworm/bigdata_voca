This 

is  becoming  an 

increasingly  popular  place  as 
people  are  more  and  more  conscious  of  their  health. 
According  to  the  American  Council  on  Exercise  (ACE), 
water  reduces  the  weight  your  body  must  bear  by  about 
90  percent.  It  means  that  the  stress  on  weight-bearing 
joints,  bones  and  muscles  is  similarly  reduced.  That’s 
why  this  is  such  a  great  place  to  work  out  if  you’re 
recovering  from  an  injury,  if  you  need  a  break  from 
running  or  walking,  or  if  you’re  new  to  exercise.

Charles  Dickens  visited 

in  1867. 
Wherever  he  went  to  read  his  novels,  the  reception  was 
the  same.  The  night  before,  people  began  to  line  up  in 
front  of  the  auditorium.  By  morning,  the  streets  were 
campgrounds  with  men,  women  and  children  sitting  or 
sleeping  on  blankets.  Some  people  paid  more  than  ten 
times

It  was  World  War  I,  just  after  the  outbreak  of  hostilities. 
The  two  (A) captains  of  the  luxurious  and  gigantic  passenger 
ships,  the  British  ocean  liner  Carmania  and  the  German 
liner  Cap  Trafalgar,  were  both  ordered  to  convert  their 
vessels 
into  armed  merchant  cruisers.  Because  either 
would  have  been  an  easy  victim  of  a  determined  enemy, 
disguise  was  essential.  By  coincidence,  each  captain 
decided  to  disguise  his  ship  as  the  other.  By  an  even 
greater  coincidence,  they  met  in  the  South  Atlantic.  The 
outcome  was  a  remarkable  (B) engagement  that  ranks  as 
one  of  the  most  curious  naval  conflicts  of  all  time.

Harvard  Square,  my  wife  and  I  have  a  peach  tree,  a  pear 
tree,  and  an  apple  tree  that  yield  several  pounds  of  fruit  a

means  for  our  children.  I  think  the  most  important 
to  do  with  finding  a  real 
aspect  of  success  has 
passion  for  something  in  life.  It  means  a  responsibility 
to 
to  be 
forced  upon  a  youngster

growing  up.  We  cannot  expect  children  to  be  replicas 
of  us.  From 
they  are

crawling.  When 
still  empty  of 
speeding  machinery,  the  day  seemed  twice  as  long,  as 
one  passed  over  the  miles  so  slowly.  One  did  not  see 
much  of  the  world  in  a  day,  but  the  eye  could  linger 
on  what  one  saw.  If  the  inventors  could  have  known

26. Some  fishes  use  their  electroceptive  sense  for  detecting 
prey  and  for  moving  toward  or  away  from  objects  in 
the  environment.  Nowhere  is  prey  detection  with  this 
sense  better  developed  than  in  sharks.  Spiny  dogfish 
sharks,  the  common  laboratory  specimen,  locate  prey 
by  electroception.  A  shark  can  detect  and  eat  a 
flounder  that  is  hiding  in  the  sand,  and  it  will  locate 
and  eat  electric  devices 
that  are  creating  electric 
signals  similar  to  those  emitted  by  the  flounder.  On

I  had  overslept  at  the  hotel,  missing  breakfast,  and  had 
to  leap  into  my  clothes.  I  couldn’t  find  a  cab  and  had  to 
drag  my  overweight  bag  eight  blocks  to  the  Central  Bus 
Station.  I  had  huge  difficulty  persuading  the  staff  at  the 
bank  on  Johansgate  Street  to  cash  sufficient  traveler’s 
checks  to  pay  the  1,200-krone  bus  fare.  They  simply 
could  not  understand  that  the  William  McGuire  Bryson

The  monster  suddenly  felt  a  strange  need  to  get  up 
and  look  at  himself  in  the  mirror.  He  relit  his  candle. 
When  he  saw  his  face  reflected  in  the  polished  glass,  he 
scarcely  recognized  it;  it  seemed  to  him  as  though  he 
had  never  yet  seen  himself.  His  eyes  looked  to  him 
enormous,  and  he  was  pale;  yes,  without  doubt  he  was 
pale,  very  pale.  He  remained  standing  in  front  of  the 
mirror.  He  put  out  his  tongue,  as  though  to  check  the 
state  of  his  health,  and  abruptly  the  thought  struck  him 
like  a  bullet,  “The  day  after  tomorrow,  at  this  very  hour, 
I  may  no  longer  be  in  this  world.”  His  heart  began  its 
furious  beating  again.

Flood  waters  are  dangerous.  The  force  of  a  few  inches 
of  water  can  toss  you  to  the  ground.  While  camping, 
just  keep  your  radio  turned  on  and  tuned  to  a  weather 
station.  Tons  of  water  miles  away  can  reach  and  swallow 
you  in  a  few  minutes.  If  there’s  a  flood,  just  get  out  of 
the  car.  Cars  can  be  easily  swept  away  in  just  two  feet 
of  water.  If  you  have  limited  time,  take  only  family

As  far  back  as  I  can  remember,  I’ve  heard  about  the 
importance  of  a  positive  attitude  and  the  powerful  effect 
it  could  have  on  my  life.  I  heard  it  from  my  parents, 
teachers,  coaches,  and  supervisors  over  the  years.  How 
many  times  in  your  life  have  you  been  encouraged  to 
have  a  positive  attitude?  Although  attitude  plays  an 
important  role 
life,  many  people  don’t 
realize  the  influence  it  has  on  their  performance  at  work 
and  on  their  relationships.  The  attitude  that  you  carry 
around  makes  an  incredible  difference  in  your  life.  It  can 
be  a  powerful  tool  for  positive  action.  Or  it  can  be  a 
poison  that  weakens  your  ability  to  fulfill  your  potential. 
Your  attitude  dictates  whether  you  are  living  life  or  life

Social  scientists  have  long  noted  the  relationship  between 
lifelong  education  and  income.  Put  simply,  individuals  who 
have  invested  in  further  education  and  in-service  training 
earn  more  money  than  individuals  who  have  not.  Human 
capital  consists  of  the  skills  and  knowledge  that  an  individual 
uses  to  produce  goods  and  services.  Human  capital  is 
developed  by  investing  time,  money  and  energy  in  the 
acquisition  of  new  skills  that  enable  us  to  be  more 
productive.  By  continuously  investing  in  ourselves,  we 
expect  to  become  more  productive  and  to  gain  a  higher 
income,  greater  job  satisfaction  and  better  professional 
opportunities.

Perhaps 

the  outstanding  characteristic  of  my 
nine-year-old  child  is  the  fact  that  he  is  emerging 
from  a  long,  strong  preoccupation  with  his  mother. 
Whereas  at  eight  he  could  admit  the  presence  of 
Mother,  now  he  often  seems  to  resent  her  presence 
and  her  demands.  At  eight  he  counted  on  his 
mother.  Or  he  was  related  strongly  and  warmly  to 
his  mother.  This  nine-year-old  child  isn’t  willing  to 
ask  others  for  help.  In  addition,  he  is  eager  to 
achieve  something  for  himself.  He  has  become  a 
self-starter  and,  once  started,  wishes  to  continue  in 
his  own  way,  at  his  own  time,  in  his  own  direction.

From  the  5th  to  the  15th  centuries,  Europeans  with

Those  of  us  who  watched  the  lunar  voyage  of

In  breeding  these  living  organisms,  we  try  to  keep 
their  best  traits.  Two  cows,  for  example,  might  vary 
in  size,  color,  size  of  horns,  ability  to  survive  the 
cold  and  amount  of  milk  produced.  When  farmers 
choose  which  cow  to  breed  from,  they  will  choose 
the  one  with  the  most  useful  characteristics.  They 
will  hope  that  the  genes  for  these  characteristics 
will  be  passed  on  to  the  cow’s  calf. 

Humans  use  living  organisms  for  many  purposes. 
We  breed  crops  and  farm  animals  for  food.  We 
breed  dogs  for  companionship,  sport  and  appearance. 
We  breed  flowers  to  look  attractive.  We  use  bacteria 
and  fungi  to  make  foods  like  yogurt  and  cheese.

This  is  called  artificial  selection.  Artificial  selection

or  plants  being  bred.  You  only  have  to  look  at  all  the 
different  varieties  of  dogs  to  see  what  selective 
breeding  and  artificial  selection  can  do.

Among  all  the  sciences,  mathematics  probably  has 
longest  unbroken  history － rivaled  only  by 
the 
astronomy.  Both  go  back  at  least  to  the  ancient 
Babylonians,  and  discoveries  made 
then  remain 
important  today.  And  just  as  astronomy  builds  on  the 
discoveries  of  the  past,  so  does  mathematics. 

Astronomy  is  based  on  observations  of  the  real  world, 
                (A)                  mathematics  is  a  shared  social 
construct  of  ideas.  Interestingly,  however,  ideas  are  the 
driving  force  of  astronomy,  and  mathematics  has 
grown  out  of  attempts  to  model  the  real  world － to 
count  the  passing  days,  to  measure  the  sizes  of  fields, 
and  to  calculate  the  taxes  owed  to  the  king.

One  of  the  most  common  barriers  to  effective  learning 
is  that  people  do  not  pay  attention  to  situations  in  which 
new  information  is  presented.  Think  about  what  your 
father  or  mother  wore  to  work  this  morning.  Can  you 
remember  what  (a) tie  he  had  on?  W hich  (b) blouse 
she  wore?  What  color  your  brother’s  T-shirt  was?  By 
actively  looking  and  making  a  conscious  effort  to  take 
in  this  type  of  information,  trivial  as  it  may  seem,  you 
begin  to  train  your  (c) brain  to  log  in  details.  By 
engaging  in  this  type  of  observation  process,  we  can 
absorb  details  and  meaning  from  a  new  face,  event, 
or  conversation,  which  helps  us  to  remember  it.

When  we  have  little  interest  in  something,  it  is 
often  difficult  to  remember  because  we  are  not 
paying  full  attention.  Many  of  us  forget  (d) names 
seconds  after  being  introduced  to  someone  new.  We 
need  to  slow  down  just  enough  to  notice  what  is 
being  said  and  decide  whether  (A) it  is  important  or 
not.  Samuel  Johnson  simply  puts  it  this  way,  “The 
true  art  of  memory  is  the  art  of  attention.”

Memory  for  (e) street  directions  is  an  excellent 
example.  If  you  drive  yourself  to  a  new  place  by 
following  directions,  you’ll  probably  remember  how 
to  get  there  days  or  even  weeks  later.  If  you  are 
merely  a  passenger  on  your  first  trip,  you  are  likely 
to  get  lost  on  your  first  solo  trip.  The  goal  in  active 
observation  is  (B) to  mentally  stay  in  the  driver’s
