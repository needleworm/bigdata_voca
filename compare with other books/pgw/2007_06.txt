[1점]

It  is  one  of  the  greatest  handicaps  to  getting  to  know 
people  quickly  and  getting  close  to  them.  You’re  afraid 
that  the  other  fellow  will  not  like  you,  so  you  hole  up  in 
your  shell,  like  a  snail  that  thinks  it  is  about  to  be 
attacked.  Take  the  risk.  Bet  on  his  being  friendly.  You 
won’t  win  every  time,  but  the  odds  are  heavily  in  your 
favor.  Remember  most  people  do  yearn  for  friendship, 
just  as  you  do.  The  reason  the  other  fellow  does  not 
always  appear  friendly  may  be  that  he  is  afraid  you  will 
reject  him.  Speak  to  him  first,  then  chances  are  he  will 
begin  to  warm  up.

① Pride
④ Fear

② Sympathy

③ Jealousy

19. 다음 글에서 밑줄 친  their  feelings가 뜻하는 바로 가장

적절한 것은? [1점]

Working  or  not,  all  mothers  may  be  relieved  to  learn 
that  motherhood  may  not  come  automatically  to  anyone 
after  all.  An  anthropologist  at  the  University  of  California  at 
Davis  studied  primates,  including  humans,  to  understand 
better  the  biological  relationship  between  mothers  and  their 
children.  She  said  that  mothers  are  not  innately  selfless 
beings  but  learn  to  care  for  their  babies  over  time.  In 
addition,  a  mother’s  own  well-being  may  conf lict  with 
nurturing  her  baby.  “It  is  instructive  for  women  to  understand 
that  they  don’t  need  to  feel  guilty  and  ashamed  about 
their  feelings,”  she  said.

When  a  concert  violinist  ① was  asked  the  secret  of  her 
success,  she  replied,  “Planned  neglect.”  Then  she  explained, 
“When  I  was  in  school,  there  were  many  things  that  ② were 
demanded  my  time  and  energy.  When  I  went  to  my  room 
after  breakfast,  I  made  my  bed,  straightened  the  room, 
③ dusted  the  floor,  and  did  whatever  else  came  to  my 
attention.  Then  I  hurried  to  violin  practice.  I  ④ found  I 
wasn’t  progressing  as  I  thought  I  should,  so  I  reversed 
I 
things.  Until  my  practice  period  was  completed, 
deliberately  ⑤ neglected  everything  else.  That  program  of 
planned  neglect,  I  believe,  accounts  for  my  success.”

An  alchemist  commonly  used  a  double-bottomed  melting 
pot  to  deceive  the  audience.  A  layer  of  gold  dust  was 
put  in  the  bottom  of  a  copper  or  brass  pot,  and  covered 
with  wax.  ① This  wax  was  painted  to  look  like  the  real 
bottom.  ② The  alchemist  placed  some  mercury  in  the 
melting  pot  and  heated  it.  ③ To  impress  his  audience,  he 
would  throw  in  some  mysterious  powder  and  pronounce  a 
few  equally  mysterious  phrases.  ④ Gold  was  looked  upon  as 
the  most  perfect  metal,  and  all  other  metals  as  imperfect. 
⑤ Lastly,  he  would  say,  “Behold!”  and  a  lump  of  precious 
metal  would  be  found  in  the  bottom  of  his  pot.

24. People  seem  to  be  more  motivated  by  the  thought  of 
losing  something  than  by  the  thought  of  gaining  something 
of  equal  value.  According  to  some  researchers,  college  students 
experienced  much  stronger  emotions  when  asked  to  imagine 
losses  as  opposed  to  gains  in  their  romantic  relationships  or 
in  their  grade  point  averages.  Especially,  under  conditions 
of  risk  and  uncertainty,  the  threat  of  potential  loss  plays  a

25. I  was  using  a  microcassette  recorder  to  study  for  a  final 
examination.  As  I  was  listening  to  my  own  reading  of  a 
stack  of  notes,  I  heard  myself  reacting  to  the  words.  It  was 
actually  kind  of  funny.  This  gave  me  the  idea  of  recording 
myself  when  I  was  angry,  upset  or  depressed,  then  listening 
to  it  later.  When  I  was  feeling  somewhat  miserable  and 
sad,  I  started  taping  myself.  The  next  day,  when  I  was 
feeling  alright  again,  I  played  it  back.  It  was  a  real 
eye-opener!  It  really  gave  me  an  opportunity  to  see  myself

26. Young  writers  visiting  the  National  Library  are  brought 
to  a  special  section  where  the  rough  drafts  of  famous 
authors  are  kept.  This  practice  has  quite  an  impact  on 
those  writers  who  previously  thought  that  the  works  of 
geniuses  arrived  complete  in  a  single  stroke  of  inspiration. 
Here,  young  writers  can  examine  how  often  a  successful 
author  starts  with  an  apparently  random  series  of  ideas. 
Later,  many  of  these  ideas  are  not  included  in  the  final 
design,  but  they  were  essential  to  the  process  of  developing 
a  new  concept.  That  is,  the  early  drafts  are  not  discarded 
like  mistakes,  but  are  viewed  as

27. Stephanie  Scott’s  pit  bull,  Reilly  Roo,  is  friendly  and 
affectionate,  even  with  strangers.  “There’s  nothing  about  her 
that  makes  her  different  from  any  other  dog,”  says  Stephanie. 
She  and  others  say  that  a  few  irresponsible  owners  give  pit 
bulls  a  bad  name  by  raising  them  to  fight.  They  point  to  a 
government  study  which  says  that  laws  banning  specific 
dog  breeds  do  not  work  because  _____________________. 
Some  pit  bull  lovers  argue  that  other  dog  breeds  are  just 
as,  if  not  more,  dangerous.  “I  tell  people  who  come  to  my 
house,  ‘Don’t  worry  about  my  pit  bulls;  worry  about  my 
toy  poodle.  She  will  bite  you,’ ”  says  Devi  Barry,  a 
Michigan  resident.  [3점]

It’s  an  ugly  sweater  with  red  plastic  buttons  and  a 
collar  and  sleeves  all  stretched  out  like  you  could  use  it 
for  a  jump  rope.  It  looks  a  thousand  years  old,  and  even 
if  it  belonged  to  me  I  wouldn’t  admit  it.  But  Ms.  Price 
keeps  saying,  “It  has  to  belong  to  somebody.”  Then  Sylvia 
Saldivar  says,  “I  think  it  belongs  to  Rachel.”  To  my 
shame,  Ms.  Price  believes  her.  An  ugly  sweater  like  that, 
all  worn  out  and  old!  Ms.  Price  takes  the  sweater  and 
puts  it  right  on  my  desk,  but  when  I  open  my  mouth  to 
protest,  nothing  comes  out.

The  above  chart  shows  how  to  cook  meat  using  a 
microwave  oven.  The  meat  is  heated  in  the  oven  during  the 
microwave  time.  After  the  microwave  time,  it  continues 
to  cook  by  itself  during  the  standing  time.  Now  it  is 
ready  to  be  eaten.  ① As  you  can  see  in  the  chart,  the 
power  level  should  be  set  to  medium-high  to  cook  meat 
properly  in  the  microwave  oven.  ② It  takes  more  microwave 
time  to  cook  lamb  ribs  than  pork  chops.  ③ Beef  steak 
and  turkey  breast  both  take  the  same  total  time.  ④ You  can 
eat  chicken  wings  six  minutes  after  they  go  into  the  oven. 
⑤ You  should  let  chicken  wings  cook  longer  than  beef  steak.

The  Douglas  Academy  has  continued  to  develop. 
After  three  years  of  continuing  academic  achievements, 
we  successfully  introduced  Chinese,  Spanish  and  French 
into  the  curriculum,  along  with  other  new  courses,  to 
keep  the  academy  vital  and  to  meet  better  the  students’ 
needs  in  this  age  of  globalization.  We  also  recruited 
outside  supporters  who  gave  financial  and  other  types  of 
aid  to  help  us  carry  out  these  new  programs.  We  want 
students  to  spend  most  of  their  time  in  the  academy, 
since  many  students  do  not  have  quiet  places  to  study, 
ready  access  to  tutors,  or  recreation  areas  in  which  to 
play  sports  or  to  take  part  in  other  activities.

Malthus  and  Richardo  were  economists  from 

totally 
different  backgrounds.  Whereas  Malthus  came  from  an 
old  English  family  and  took  holy  orders  in  the  Church  of 
England,  Richardo  was  born  the  son  of  a  Jewish  immigrant 
in  1772.  His  father,  Abraham  Richardo,  was  one  of  the 
twelve  “Jew  Brokers”  permitted  to  practice  as  a  stockbroker 
in  London.  While  Malthus  received  careful  tutoring  and 
schooling  at  Cambridge,  Richardo  went  to  work  with  his 
father  at  fourteen  and  began  to  learn  complicated  financial 
systems  and  strategies  “on  the  job,”  so  to  speak.  And  he 
learned  well.  By  his  mid-twenties,  the  man  with  the 
“Midas  touch”  had  established  his  own  business  and  made 
a  fortune  through  stocks  and  real  estate  investments.

① Malthus는 유서 깊은 영국 가문 출신이다.

② Richardo는 유대인 이민자의 아들로 태어났다.
③ Malthus는 런던에서 증권 중개업 허가를 받았다.

④ Richardo는 복잡한 금융 체계와 전략을 체득했다.

⑤ Richardo는 주식과 부동산 투자로 많은 돈을 벌었다.

Pay  toilets  used  to  be  the  rule  in  airports  and  bus  and 
train  stations.  They  were  never  meant  to  be  profit-making 
enterprises,  but  a  method  to  help  pay  the  cost  of  cleaning 
the  restrooms.  It  was  thought  that  the  entrance  fee  would 
motivate  users  to  keep  them  cleaner.  It  didn’t  work, 
though.  Instead,  pay  toilets  were  often  trashed  by  angry 
users.  The  vast  majority  of  pay  toilets  were  operated  by 
city  governments,  but  they  were  not  able  to  endure  the 
the  operating  difficulties.  Consequently, 
complaints  and 
pay  toilets  have  been  gradually  fading  out  of  sight.

Imagine  how  nice  it  would  be  if  you  had  a  whole 
extra  hour  in  the  morning  to  do  some  things  you’ve  been 
waiting  to  do,  like  taking  a  walk.  Adding  an  extra  hour 
to  the  day,  especially  if  you  use  it  to  do  something  other 
than  work,  is  an  effective  way  to  relieve  stress  and  to 
give  yourself  the  feeling  of  having  much  more  time  and 
energy  throughout  the  day.  This  may  mean  going  to  bed 
an  hour  earlier,  but  having  an  extra  hour  in  the  morning

This  is  a  highly  efficient  headgear.  It  is  a  light  and  soft 
cap  with  elastic  pads  that  stiffen  upon  ① collision.  “It 
doesn’t  protect  you  as  much  as  a  hard  helmet,”  says  the 
Swiss  businessman  who  released  this  product  first,  “but 
it’s  for  people  who  don’t  like  to  wear  helmets.”  The  pads 
on  the  cap  are  made  of  a  special  material  that  ② loosens 
in  response  to  quick  movements  or  impacts.  Strike  your 
head,  and  the  shock  causes  the  molecules  inside  the 
padding  to  tightly  ③ bond,  forming  a  structure  that 
resembles  a  ④ chain-link  fence.  This  stiffening  helps  absorb 
and  redistribute  the  force  of  the  ⑤ impact.

36. A  man  who  had  been  a  poor  shepherd  in  his  early 
years  became  a  very  wealthy,  respected  diplomat,  and  he 
was  appointed  as  an  ambassador  to  a  country  in  Africa.  In 
his  residence  near  the  embassy,  he  had  one  room  known  as 
“the  shepherd’s  room.”  In  that  room  were  reproductions  of 
hills,  valleys,  running  streams,  rocks,  barns  and  fences  for 
the  sheep.  Here  were  the  sticks  he  had  carried  and  the 
clothes  he  had  worn  as  a  shepherd  when  looking  after  the 
sheep.  When  asked  one  day  the  reason  for  this,  he  replied, 
“If  ever  my  heart  is  tempted  to  arrogance  and  pride,  I  go 
into  that  room  and  remind  myself  of  what  I  once  was.”

37. This  morning  I  had  a  longing  for  some  orange  juice.  I 
knew  there  must  be  some  in  the  refrigerator  since  my 
roommate  went  shopping  yesterday.  I 
took  an  orange- 
labeled  can  out  of  the  refrigerator  and  made  myself  a 
glass.  When  I  tasted  it,  it  was  strange.  I  spat  it  out  in  the 
sink  since  I  was  sure  that  it  was  spoiled.  I  decided  that  I 
might  as  well  take  it  back  to  the  grocer’s  and  get  our 
money  back.  I  fished  the  can  out  of  the  garbage  and 
looked  at  the  label.  To  my  surprise,  it  said,  “Tangerine 
Juice.”  I  couldn’t  believe  it.  I  tasted  some  of  the  juice  left 
in  the  glass  and ... it  was  good  tangerine  juice!

naturalism.  Goya,  however,  combined  a 
perception  with  his  freer,  open  technique  of  painting.  This 
provided  his  portraits  with  an  unusual  degree  of  animation, 
as  though  a  smile  had  briefly  flashed  across  a  sitter’s  face

It  has  been  said  that  a  weed  is  “any  plant  growing  in 

the  wrong  place.”  Yet  with  a  small  shift  in  perspective  we 
can  change  this  definition  to  “a  plant  whose  virtues  have 
not  yet  been  discovered.”  Many  weeds  are  edible  and 
medicinal.  They  also  increase  biodiversity,  provide  valuable 
information  about  the  condition  of  our  land,  or  can  bring 
up  valuable  nutrients  from  the  subsoil  to  the  surface,  where 
they  eventually  become  available  to  other  plants.  Those 
plants  that  we  call  weeds  are  often  beneficial.

some  muscle  fibers.  “These  lie  inactive  until  you’re  running

A  code  is  constantly  under  attack  from  codebreakers. 
When  the  codebreakers  have  developed  a  new  weapon

(A)  My  name  is  Caroline  Finch.  I  live  in  Albuquerque, 
New  Mexico.  In  the  downtown  area  I  often  see  homeless 
people  begging  for  money  all  around  the  stoplights.  I 
used  to  give  a  lot  of  money  to  them,  feeling  sorry  for 
their  misfortune.  But  as  time  passed,  I  became  a  single 
mom  with  no  home,  a  huge  debt  and  hardly  any  income. 
As  a  result,  I  became  very  bitter,  and  stopped  giving  to 
the  people  on  the  side  of  the  road.  Eventually,  things 
started  to  change  for  me.  I  became  responsible  enough 
to  have  a  home,  a  backyard  for  my  daughter,  and  plenty 
of  food.  I  saved  money  and  started  to  pull  myself  out 
of  debt.

(B)  My  hair  stood  up  when  I  saw  this.  I  picked  them 
up  and  gave  them  to  him.  He  burst  out  with  joy  and 
tears  in  his  eyes,  “Wow,  you  just  made  it  possible  for 
me  to  see  my  mom  for  Christmas!  Thank  you  so  much. 
The  bus  that  has  this  great  Christmas  discount  is  leaving 
in  20  minutes!”  It  was  a  moment  I’ll  never  forget.  I 
think  that  man  won’t  forget  it  either,  but  I  was  the
one  who  got  the  best  gift  in  life.

(C)  One  day,  we  saw  a  homeless  person  with  the 

sign,  “Will  work  for  food.”  I  passed  by.  My  daughter 
commented,  “Mommy,  you  used  to  give  to  those  people 
in  need.”  I  replied,  “Honey,  they  just  use  that  money 
for  alcohol  or  other  bad  things.”  She  didn’t  respond.  But 
when  I  said  that,  it  didn’t  feel  right.

(D)  Three  days  later,  I  was  driving  to  pick  up  my 
daughter  from  school.  A  man  was  standing  on 
the 
corner,  and  something  deep  inside  me  said,  “Just  help 
the  guy.”  So  I  rolled  down  my  window,  and  he  ran 
over  with  enthusiasm.  He  said,  “God  bless  you!  I  only 
need  77  cents.”  I  reached  into  my  ashtray  and  oddly 
enough,  there  sat  three  quarters  and  two  pennies.

Cold  and  exhausted,  I  went  to  a  small  restaurant  just 
beside  the  station,  the  only  one  which  opened  at  night. 
It  only  had  four  tables  and  several  benches.  A  woman 
who  was  both  the  waitress  and  the  cook  took  care  of 
three  big  pots.  (a) Flames  were  dancing  under  them,  now 
blue  and  then  red,  comforting  my  body  and  soul.  In  one 
pot,  chicken  soup  was  bubbling  and  steaming.  Large 
pieces  of  pepper  were  floating  on  the  surface.  I  had 
intended  to  get  something  hot  to  drink  to  warm  myself, 
but  now  I  hesitated.  I  could  not  decide  whether  I 
should  buy  a  bowl  of  chicken  soup  since  I  cannot  stand 
(b) strong  pepper.

The  woman  kindly  asked  me  to  taste  (c) the  chicken 
soup  first  and  then  make  the  decision.  Her  voice  was  a 
little  bit  rough,  reminding  me  of  my  mother.  Because  of 
(d) her  kindness,  I  ordered  one  bowl.  The  woman  stirred 
the  soup  and  scooped  up  (e) lots  of  meat  for  me.  I  sat 
in  a  corner  sipping  the  soup  slowly,  casually  listening  to 
country  fellows’  chatting,  which  was  like  flowing  water. 
Here  it  was  simple.  Here  it  was  warm.  I  wished  the 
night  would  have  been  longer  so  that  I  could  stay  here 
longer.  I  did  not  care  about  the  restaurant’s  smallness.  I 
did  not  care  about  its  lack  of  cleanliness.  I  just  wanted 
to  enjoy  its  quietness  and  the  warmth.  I  was  just  afraid 
of  returning  to  the  cruel  world,  full  of  _______________.
