Earth  is  a  large,  round  planet.  To  see  all  of  Earth,  we 
would  have  to  go  around  it  in  a  spacecraft.  Thanks  to 
this,  however,  we  don’t  have  to  do  that.  Shaped  like  a 
soccer  ball,  this  represents  Earth  as  round  rather  than  flat, 
and  shows  what  it  would  look  like  from  outer  space. 
This  shows  distances,  directions,  and  the  shapes  and  sizes 
of  areas  on  Earth.  This  also  has  a  number  of  lines 
including  one  that  runs  around  the  center  and  divides  it 
into  two  halves  horizontally.

Many  people  believe  that  a  snowflake  cannot  last  more 
than  a  few  minutes  indoors  because  ① it  is  a  frozen 
water  crystal.  However,  you  can  catch  a  snowflake  and 
the  chemist  Tryggvi 
keep  ② it  forever.  According 
Emlisson,  ‘superglue’  can  be  used  to  do  this  job.  It  is  a 
thin,  runny  glue  with  special  molecules  which  hardens 
anything  ③ it  touches.  With  that  in  mind,  Emlisson 
did  an  experiment  with  a  snowflake  in  January  1979. 
He  took  a  snowflake,  locked  ④ it  in  a  drop  of  the 
‘superglue,’  and  kept  it  for  decades.  Recently  he  showed 
that  ⑤ it  was  still  well-preserved.

것은? [1점]

Sometimes  promises  made  in  good  faith  can’t  be  kept. 
Even  though  we  strive  to  be  error-free,  it’s  inevitable  that 
problems  will  occur.  Not  everything  that  affects  your 
customer’s  experience  with  you  is  within  your  control. 
What  should  you  do  when  the  service  promise  is  broken? 
When  you  discover  a  broken  promise  or  have  one 
pointed  out  to  you,  the  first  thing  to  do  is  to  apologize. 
Don’t  waste  time  blaming  yourself,  your  company,  or 
your  customer.  Admit  that  something  has  gone  wrong, 
and  immediately  find  out  what  your  customer’s  needs  are.

Philosophy  is,  simply  put,  a  way  of  thinking.  More 
accurately,  however,  it  is  a  set  of  mental  tools.  And  that 
fact  is  directly  related  to  the  question  of  (A) what / why
we  study  philosophy.  It’s  not  just  to  amaze  our  friends 
with  our  own  profound  thinking,  or  confuse  them  with 
(B) unexpected / unexpectedly questions,  although  some 
college  students  may  value  that  possibility  the  most 
taking  philosophy  courses.  We  study  philosophy 
in 
(C) because / because  of the  mental  skills  it  helps  us  develop.

College  life  is  busy.  There  are  too  many  demands  on 
your  schedule.  Activities,  friends,  and  pastimes  may  cause 
some  difficulties  in  your  ① performing  the  real  job  at  hand. 
When  you  are  feeling  ② overwhelmed  by  presentations, 
paper  deadlines,  or  tests,  you  will  probably  spend  all  your 
time  studying  ③ to  deal  with  these  pressures.  However,  this 
lack  of  time  for  relaxation  makes  it  more  difficult  ④ get 
the  most  out  of  your  studies.  Promise  ⑤ yourself  that  no 
matter  how  much  work  you  have,  you  will  always  relax 
during  one  full  evening.  You  will  work  better  if  you  take 
time  off  for  relaxation.

Few  animals  have  been  so  mercilessly  exploited  for 
their  fur  as  the  beaver.  ① In  the  eighteenth  and  nineteenth 
centuries,  beaver  furs  were  worth  their  weight  in  gold. 
② As  a  result,  by  1896,  at  least  14  American  states  had 
announced  that  all  of  their  beavers  had  been  killed. 
③ By  the  beginning  of  the  twentieth  century,  it  looked  as 
if  the  beaver  was  about  to  disappear  from  the  face  of  the 
earth.  ④ The  beaver  is  a  furry  animal  like  a  large  rat 
with  a  big  flat  tail.  ⑤ However,  thanks  to  a  beaver 
recovery  program,  which  included  trapping  and  relocating 
to  protected  areas,  particularly  in  suburban  areas  of 
the  United  States,  beavers  have  made  an 
impressive 
comeback  throughout  the  country.

25. The  distinctive  property  of 

cultural  behavior, 

as 
ethologists  use  the  term,  is  the  way  it  is  passed  on  from 
one  generation  to  the  next.  Instead  of  being  inherited  by 
the  process  of  Mendelian  genetics,  it  is  ‘inherited’  by 
imitation.  An  animal  acquires  a  behavior  pattern  by 
imitating  it  from  another.  Thus,  for  a  species  to  acquire  a 
culture,  its  members  should  be  able  not  only  to  learn  and 
memorize  but  also  to  meet  other  members  of  its  own 
species  sufficiently  often.  Cultural  behavior  is,  therefore, 
most  likely  to  be  found  in  species  that  ________________.

26. How  can  I  learn  to  be  a  manager?  A  familiar  answer  to 
this  question  is  to  say  that  managers  learn  from  experience. 
But  can  experience  alone  be 
to  be  a 
manager?  Several  writers  have  expressed  their  doubts  on 
this  matter.  Oscar  Wilde  noted  that  ‘experience  is  the  name 
everyone  gives  to  their  mistakes.’  And  the  historian  Froude 
wrote  that  ‘experience  teaches  slowly  and  at  the  cost  of 
mistakes.’  Experience  is  an  essential  way  of  learning  to 
improve  but  is  an  __________  instrument.  We  also  need 
guidance  from  a  good  manager  who  will  help  us  to  learn 
from  mistakes  and  make  better  use  of  them  in  the  future.

27. Even  a  relatively  small  increase  in  _______________ 
can  make  people  much  happier  and  lengthen  their  lives. 
This  was  evident  when  doctors  in  retirement  villages  in  the 
United  States  encouraged  residents  to  decide  the  details  of 
their  daily  lives  themselves.  They  were  no  longer  simply 
presented  with  their  meals,  but  could  choose  from  a  menu. 
While  previously  the  caretakers  watered  the  plants,  the 
elderly  took  over  this  responsibility  for  themselves.  These

A  bicycle  is  a  two-wheeled  steerable  machine  that  is 
pedaled  by  the  rider’s  feet.  The  wheels  are  ① installed

At  certain  times  in  history,  cultures  have  taken  it  for 
granted  that  a  person  was  not  fully  human  unless  he  or 
she  learned  to  master  thoughts  and  feelings.  In  ancient 
Sparta,  in  Republican  Rome,  and  among  the  British  upper

classes  of  the  Victorian  era,   
held  responsible  for  keeping  control  of  their  emotions. 
Anyone  who 
too  easily  was

34. Man  has  built  his  world:  he  has  built  factories  and

fruit,  and  so  on.  But  he  is  not  really  the  master  any  more 
of  the  world  he  has  built;  on  the  contrary,  this  man-made 
world  has  become  his  master,  before  whom  he  bows  down, 
and  whom  he  tries  to  please  as  best  he  can.  The  work  of 
his  own  hands  has  become  his  master.  He  seems  to  be 
driven  by  self-interest,  but  in  reality  he  has  become  an 
instrument  for  the  purposes  of  the  very  machine  his  hands

I  heard  a  sound,  and  my  heart  beat  quickly.  I  was 
excited,  and  when  at  last  I  saw  him  coming  slowly  down 
the  stairs,  I  caught  my  breath.  He  was  a  tall  old  man 
with  abundant  white  hair,  but  his  bushy  eyebrows  were 
dark  still;  they  made  his  great  eyes  flash  with  a  more 
grave  fire.  It  was  wonderful  that  at  his  age  those  black 
eyes  should  still  preserve  their  brilliance.  There  were  in 
his  air  assurance  and  gentleness.  He  was  as  I  should 
to  be,  and  as  I  watched  him,  I 
have  wished  him 
understood  how  he  had  moved  men’s  minds  and  touched

In  the  United  States,  some  people  maintain  that  TV

leading  some  judges  to  pass  harsher  sentences  than  they 
otherwise  might.  However, 
some  benefits 
connected  to  the  televising  of  trials.  It  will  serve  to 
educate  the  public  about  the  court  process.  It  will  also 
provide 
full  and  accurate  coverage  of  exactly  what 
happens  in  any  given  case.  Therefore,  it  is  necessary  to 
televise  trials  to  increase  the  chance  of  a  fair  trial.  And, 
if  trials  are  televised,  a  huge  audience  will  be  made 
aware  of  the  case,  and  crucial  witnesses  who  would 
otherwise  have  been  ignorant  of  the  case  may  play  their 
potential  role  in  it.

36. One  of 

the  most 

important  aspects  of  human 
communication  is  that  past  experiences  will  affect  your 
behavior.  Even  when  you  start  to  discuss  some  event  with 
your  friends,  you  may  soon  discover  there  are  differences 
in  your  perceptions.  What  you  think  boring  your  friends 
may  find  exciting;  what  you  consider  pointless  they  may 
find  meaningful.  The  messages  you  receive  may  be  the 
same  for  each  of  you.  Yet,  each  person  experiences  a 
variety  of  feelings  and  sensations,  because  each  has  a 
unique  personality  and  background.  Each  of  you  brings 
different  backgrounds  to  the  event  and,  as  a  result,  each 
attributes  different  meanings  to  the  shared  experience.

37. The  family  is  an  easy  target  for  those  who  regard  ‘bad 
people  doing  bad  things’  as  the  basic  cause  of  social 
problems.  They  assume  that  when  the  family  fails,  the 
rest  of  society  fails.  This  view  of  the  world  is  defective 
in  two  fundamental  respects.  First,  it  does  not  consider 
the  fact  that  families  reflect  social  conditions.  Second,  it 
ignores  the  structural  reasons  for  family  breakdown  and 
the  world. 
the  profound  changes  occurring 
Even 
families  are  going 
through  similar  changes  as  a  result  of  global  economic 
changes.  This  phenomenon  shows  the  fact  that  families 
cannot  avoid  social  influences  on  their  everyday  lives.

Oaks  are  kings  of  the  forest.  Most  of  these  trees  take 
100  years  to  reach  maturity.  They  can  grow  up  to  150 
trunks  and 
feet  high.  The

wide-spreading  branches.  The 
is  usually  deeply 
toothed,  but  in  some  species  it  is  almost  smooth  at  the 
edge.  Oaks  vary  in  appearance  but  are  easily  recognized 
by  their  fruit ― a  round  nut  set  in  a  woody  cup.  Native 
Americans  and  New  England  pioneers  boiled  and  ate  the 
nuts  of  the  white  oak.  Squirrels  and  some  birds  store 
them  for  winter  food.  Oaks  grow  widely  throughout  the 
mild  temperature  zone  of  the  Northern  Hemisphere.  A 
few  species  grow  at  high  altitudes  in  the  tropics.

Maria  Edgeworth  was  born  in  Oxfordshire  in  1767.  On 
her  father’s  second  marriage  in  1773,  she  went  with  him 
to  Ireland.  Her  father  employed  her  in  keeping  accounts 
and 
tenants.  She  also  acquired  a 
familiarity  with  fashionable  people  and  with  poor  Irish 
farmers,  all  of  which  was  to  be  of  use  in  her  novels. 
Her  father  made  her  a  confidential  friend,  and  he  also 
became  her  literary  adviser.  Much  of  her  early  writing 
was  for  children,  and  it  was  not  until  1800  that  she 
appeared  as  a  novelist 
the 
publication  of  Castle  Rackrent.  Its  detailed  description  of 
Irish  characters  made  the  book  an  instant  success.  After 
the  publication  of  the  book,  she  became  one  of  Ireland’s 
major  female  writers.

41. The  zoologist  and  specialist 

in  human  behavior, 

Desmond  Morris,  says  that  the  reason  people  start  to  walk 
like  each  other  is  that  they  have  a  subconscious  need  to 
show  their  companions  that  they  agree  with  them  and  so 
fit  in  with  them.  This  is  also  a  signal  to  other  people  that 
‘we  are  together,  we  are  acting  as  one.’  Other  studies 
suggest  that  we  adopt  the  mannerisms  of  our  company  as 
well,  especially  our  superiors,  such  as  crossing  our  legs  in 
the  same  direction  as  others.  An  example  often  given  is 
when,  in  a  meeting,  the  boss  scratches  his  nose  and 
others  at  the  table  then  follow  him  without  realizing  it.

is  evident 

that  humans 

tend 

to  exploit  natural 

resources  to  benefit  themselves.  It  is  equally  evident  that 
the  use  of  natural  resources  without  restoring  them  will 
eventually  lead  to  their  destruction.  There  are  two  extreme 
positions  on  the  issue.  Some  people  maintain  that  human

dominant  species  humans  have  the  right  to  exploit  all  other 
species.  Other  people  recognize  humans  as  the  only  one

preserve  other  species.  They  believe  that  humans  have  the 
moral  obligation  to  protect  all  other  forms  of  life.

There  were  some  places  of  worship  in  the  city,  and  the 
deep  notes  of  their  bells  echoed  over  the  town  from 
morning  until  night.  The  sun  was  shining  brightly  and 
cheerily,  and 
the  air  was  warm.  The  streams  were 
flowing  with  bubbling  water,  and  the  tender  songs  of 
birds  came  floating  in  from  the  fields  beyond  the  city. 
The  trees  were  already  awake  and  embraced  by  the  blue 
sky.  Everything  around  the  neighborhood,  the  trees,  the

You  might  think  iced  desserts  would  be  a  fairly 
recent  creation  due  to  the  problems  of  refrigeration  in 
the  past.

(A) What  we  call  ice  cream  today  was  created  in  the 
early  seventeenth  century  by  a  French  chef  for  King 
CharlesⅠ of  England.  After  that,  it  was  introduced 
and  popularized  in  the  United  States  by  First  Lady 
Dolly  Madison.

(B) He  brought  the  recipe  back  to  Italy,  where  it  has 
been  a  favorite  ever  since.  The  Arabs  and  Indians 
picked  up  the  idea  from  the  Chinese  as  well,  and 
named  this  delicious  dessert  sherbet.  But  it  did  not 
have  the  exact  form  and  name  of  ice  cream  yet.

While  we’re  walking  or  traveling,  we  normally  spend 
less  than  a  second  looking  at  everyday  objects  that  we 
encounter.  The  days  pass  by  us  without  our  really  being 
aware  of  them.  Scientists  have  discovered  that  the 
average  time  we  spend  looking  at  things  has  been 
steadily  decreasing  during  the  last  50  years.  In  their 
study,  they  also  discovered  that  this  decrease  leads  to  a 
lack  of  interest  and  enjoyment  in  life.  Just  try  looking 
at  objects  for  at  least  five  seconds.  Good  opportunities 
for  this  exercise  come  when  you’re  walking  or  looking 
out  of  a  car  or  train  window.  You’ll  find  that  five 
seconds  is  long  enough  to  help  you  appreciate  things

The  seagull,  a  hawk,  and  an  eagle  all  laughed  heartily. 
A  crow  listened  gravely.  “For  fifteen  years,  I’ve  flown 
this  country,”  said  the  eagle,  “and  I  assure  you  there  is 
no  such  thing  as  air  crystallizing.  Water,  yes;  air,  no.” 
“You  were  probably  struck  by  a  hailstone,”  the  hawk 
told  the  sparrow.  “Or  he  may  have  had  a  stroke,”  said 
the  seagull.  “What  do  you  think,  crow?”  “Why,  I  think 
maybe  the  air  crystallized  on  him,”  said  the  crow.

A  short  time  ago  some  builders,  working  on  a  studio 
left  a  huge  square  of  plate  glass 
in  Connecticut, 
standing  upright  in  a  field.  A  sparrow  flying  swiftly 
across  the  field  struck  the  glass  and  was  knocked  out. 
He  woke  and  went  to  his  club,  where  an  attendant 
bandaged  his  head.  “What  happened?”  asked  a  seagull. 
“I  was  flying  across  a  meadow  when  all  of  a  sudden 
the  air  crystallized  on  me,”  said  the  sparrow.

The  large  birds  laughed  so  loudly  that  the  sparrow

[49~50] 두 사람의 대립된 의견을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.

[Person  A] Can  you  imagine  what  the  world  today 
would  be  like  if  Leonardo  da  Vinci  had  become  a 
farmer  or  Wolfgang  Amadeus  Mozart  a  banker?  What 
would  the  world  be  like  without  art?  To  protect  and 
promote  culture,  governments  have  a  responsibility  as 
  the  arts.  Cultural 
representatives  of  society  to 
property  is  not  always  in  fashion,  but  remains  important. 
Who,  if  not  the  government,  would  house  these  treasures 
for  future  generations?  Without  governmental  aid  to  the 
arts,  there  would  be  a  great  deal  of  culture  lost  because 
of  a  lack  of  funding  to  either  promote  their  creation  or 
protect  them  for  future  generations.

(A)

[Person  B] The  importance  of  art  is  determined  by  the 
people  who  value  it,  not  by  governments  acting  as  its 
protectors.  Culture  should  not  be  shaped  by  governments, 
but  grow  naturally  from  a  society  of  people.  When 
artists  show  that  they  are  truly  gifted,  their  genius  will 
be  recognized  and  rewarded.  If  not,  it  simply  has  no 
value  in  society.  It  would  be  absurd  to  suggest  that  the 
government 
  great  plumbers,  dentists,  or  bankers. 
So,  it  is  also  absurd  to  suggest  that  governments  decide 
what  art  is  and  attempt  to  preserve  items  they  regard  as 
representative  of  our  lives.
