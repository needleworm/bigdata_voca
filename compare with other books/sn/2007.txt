When  one  group  borrows  something  such  as  ideas,  values, 
foods,  or  styles  of  architecture  from  another  group,  change 
occurs  through  diffusion.  Diffusion  is  a  process  by  which 
one  culture  or  society  borrows  from  another. 
The  extent 
and  rate  of  diffusion  depend  on  the  degree  of  social  contact. 
The  more  contact  a  group  has  with  another  group,  the 
more  likely  it  is  that  objects  or  ideas  will  be  exchanged.

To  be  a  mathematician  you  don’t  need  an  expensive 
laboratory.  The  typical  equipment  of  a  mathematician 
is 
a  blackboard  and  chalk.  It  is  better  to  do  mathematics  on 
than  on  a  piece  of  paper  because  chalk  is 
a  blackboard 
easier  to  erase,  and  mathematical  research  is  often  filled 
with  mistakes.  One  more  thing  you  need  to  do  is  to  join  a 
devotes  to  mathematics.  Not  many  mathematicians 
club 
can  work  alone;  they  need  to  talk  about  what  they  are

People  tend  to  stick  to  their  first  impressions,  even  if 

they  are  wrong.  Suppose  you  mention  the  name  of  your 
new  neighbor  to  a  friend.  “Oh,  I  know  him,”  your  friend 
replies.  “He  seems  nice  at  first,  but  it’s  all  an  act.”  Perhaps 
this  evaluation 
is  groundless.  The  neighbor  may  have 
changed  since  your  friend  knew  him,  or  perhaps  your 
friend’s  judgment  is  simply  unfair.  Whether  the  judgment  is 
accurate  or  not,  once  you  accept 
it  will  probably 
influence  the  way  you  respond  to  the  neighbor.  Even  if  this

Upon  entering  a  record  store,  one  encounters  a  wide 

variety  of  genres  from  easy  listening  to  jazz  and  classical 
music.  Jazz  and  classical  music  have  a  number  of  things  in 
common.  However,  they  also  have  a  number  of  differences. 
Before  sound  recording,  classical  music  was  passed  down 
through  written  scores,  whereas  early  jazz  mainly  relied  on 
live  performance.  The  composers  are  in  control  in  classical 
music;  they  write  the  musical  notes  along  with  detailed 
instructions.  In  jazz,  on  the  contrary,  the  performers  often 
improvise  their  own  melodies.  In  sum,  classical  music  and 
jazz  both  aim  to  provide  a  depth  of  expression  and  detail, 
but  they  ___________________________________________.

Our  guest  arrived  in  the  broadcasting  studio,  and  I 
opened  my  show  at  11:05  with  a  brief  introduction  about 
his  background.  Then  I  asked  my  first  question,  and  he 
just  said,  “I  don’t  know.”  A  few  more  questions  followed, 
but  all  were  answered  in  one  of  three  ways:  “Yes.” 
“No.”  or  “I  don’t  know.”  I  looked  up  at  the  clock  in  the 
studio.  It  was  11:09,  and  I  was  out  of  material.  I  had 
nothing  left  to  ask  this  guy.  Everyone  in  the  studio  was 
standing  around  with  the  same  thought:  “What  are  we

Of  all  the  ways  that  automobiles  damage  the  urban 
environment  and  lower  the  quality  of  life  in  big  cities, 
few  are  as  maddening  and  unnecessary  as  car  alarms. 
Alarms  are  more  than  just  an  annoyance;  they  are  a  costly 
public  health  problem  and  a  constant  irritation  to  urban 
civil  life.  The  benefits,  meanwhile,  are  nonexistent.  Auto 
makers,  alarm  installers,  insurers,  police,  and  the  biggest

Dominique-Jean  Larrey

Dominique-Jean  Larrey  was  born  on  July  8,  1766,  in 
France.  Larrey  began  his  medical  studies  in  Toulouse. 
During  the  Revolution,  in  1792,  he  joined  the  Army  of  the 
North  as  a  military  surgeon.  He  introduced  field  hospitals, 
ambulance  service,  and  first-aid  treatment  to  the  battlefield. 
He  eventually  became  principal  surgeon  of  the  French 
Army  and 
in 
almost  all  his  campaigns  in  Egypt,  Italy,  Russia,  and  finally 
at  Waterloo.  After  the  fall  of  Napoleon,  Larrey’s  medical 
reputation  saved  him,  and  he  was  named  a  member  of  the 
Academy  of  Medicine  at  its  founding  in  1820.

Floppy  Barrow

Floppy  Barrow  is  a  game  invented  by  Phil  and  Alan 
Grace,  and  Tim  Inglis  in  South  Australia.  In  the  game, 
the  players  use  a  broomstick  to  throw  an  old  bicycle  tire 
that  has  been  specially  modified  to  make  it  floppy.  The 
game  can  be  played  with  2  to  6  players  and  is  scored 
similarly  to  tennis.  It  can  be  played  with  or  without  a 
net  by  defining  the  court  and  scoring  against  mistakes, 
such  as  dropping  the  tire  in-court  or  throwing  it  out  of 
bounds  on  the  opponents’  side.  Floppy  Barrow  builds 
upper  body  muscles  a  lot,  so  it  provides  a  good  and 
exciting  form  of  exercise.

All  travellers  should  ensure  they  have  adequate  travel 

insurance  before  they  depart.  A  suitable  insurance  policy 
should  provide  coverage  for  medical  expenses  arising  from

vacation  money,  and  cancellation  of  the  holiday.  Please 
keep  your  insurance  policy  and  emergency  contact  details

Every  society  needs  heroes,  and  every  society  has  them. 

Some  heroes  shine  in  the  face  of  great  adversity,  performing 
amazing  deeds  in  difficult  situations;  other  heroes  do  their 
work  quietly,  unnoticed  by  most  of  us,  but  making  a 
difference  in  the  lives  of  other  people.  Whatever  their  type, 
heroes  are  selfless  people  who  perform  extraordinary  acts. 
The  true  mark  of  heroes  lies  not  necessarily  in  the  result  of 
their  actions,  but  in  what  they  are  willing  to  do  for  others

Every  mother  and  father  wants  to  raise  a  child  with  a 

strong  moral  character.  We  want  our  children  to  know 
good  from  bad,  and  right  from  wrong.  We  hope  they’ll 
learn  to  behave  morally  and  ethically,  and  grow  up  to  be 
honest  and  considerate.  In  short,  we  want  our  children  to 
develop  a  conscience
a  powerful  inner  voice  that  will 
keep  them  on  the  right  path.  But  a  conscience  does  not 
develop  by  itself,  so  the  job  of  building  one  is  ours.  It’s  a 
process  parents  need  to  work  on  day  after  day,  and  year 
after  year.  We  need  to  constantly  distinguish  right  from 
wrong,  and  to  model  appropriate  behavior.  Eventually,  our 
children  will  fully  accept  our  messages,  and  they  will 
become  the  essence  of  their  character.

Footwear  has  a  history  which  goes  back  thousands  of 

years,  and  it  has  long  been  an  article  of  necessity. 

(A) The  earliest  footwear  was  undoubtedly  born  of  the 
necessity  to  provide  some  protection  when  moving 
over  rough  ground  in  varying  weather  conditions.  In 
ancient  times,  as  today,  the  basic  type  of  shoes  worn 
depended  on  the  climate. 

(B) Shoes  have  not  always  served  such  a  purely  functional 
purpose,  however,  and  the  requirements  of  fashion 
have  dictated  some  curious  designs,  not  all  of  which 
made  walking  easy.

(C) For  instance,  in  warmer  areas  the  sandal  was,  and 
still  is,  the  most  popular  form  of  footwear,  whereas 
the  modern  moccasin  derives  from  the  original  shoes 
adopted  in  cold  climates  by  races  such  as  Eskimos 
and  Siberians.

Over  the  past  twenty  years,  I’ve  asked  thousands  of 

people,  “Where  are  you  when  you  get  your  best  ideas?” 
The  most  frequent  answers  are:  ‘resting  in  bed,’  ‘walking  in 
nature,’  ‘listening  to  music  while  driving  in  my  car,’  and 
‘relaxing  in  the  bath.’  People  rarely  get  their  best  ideas  at 
work.  What  is  so  special  about  walking  in  the  woods  or 
resting  in  bed?  Solitude  and  relaxation.  Most  people  have 
their  best  ideas  when  they  are  relaxed  and  by  themselves. 
Leonardo  da  Vinci  once  wrote,  “If  you  are  alone  you  are 
completely  yourself,  but  if  you  are  accompanied  by  a 
single  companion  you  are  half  yourself.”

The  story  starts  in  the  world  of  Homer,  where  the  stormy 

skies  and  the  dark  seas  were  ruled  by  the  mythical  gods. 
Every  advance  in  human  understanding  since  then  has  been 
made  by  brave  individuals  daring  to  step  into  the  unknown 
darkness  and  to  break  free  from  accepted  ways  of  thinking. 
Most  of  those  steps  were  small  and  difficult,  but  a  few  were 
brilliant  and  beautiful.  As  Gustave  Flaubert  wrote,  “Among 
those  who  go  to  sea  there  are  the  explorers  who  discover 
new  worlds,  adding  continents  to  the  Earth  and  stars  to  the 
heavens; 
the  eternally 
shining.”  It  is  those  explorers,  through  their  unceasing  trial 
and  error,  who  have  paved  the  way  for  us  to  follow.

we  shall  solve  our  food  problems  with  genetically  modified 
crops  newly  or  soon  to  be  developed.  Those  with  such 
technologies  will  ultimately

After  the  snowstorm  came  thick  fog,  and  in  that  fog, 
Fredrick’s  men  soon  lost  their  way  on  an  ice  river  with 
hundreds  of  big  holes  in  it.  Not  only  could  they  see 
nothing  in  front  of  them,  but  they  were  tired  and  ill  and 
could  not  walk  any  more.  So  they  had  to  stay  in  their  tents

said.  “You  can’t  come  to  the  Pole.  Take  two  men  and  go 
back  tomorrow.”  Next  day,  Fredrick  watched  regretfully  as 
Marshall’s  sled  disappeared  slowly  in  the  distance.

People  who  run  sports  camps  think  of  the  children 
first.  They  do  their  best  to  create  enjoyable  and  protective 
environments  in  which  the  children  feel  comfortable  and 
safe.  Unfortunately,  some  sports  coaches  in  the  camps 
occasionally  become  over-enthusiastic  in  their  desire  to 
help  the  children  excel.  As  a  result,  they  put  pressure 
on  them  to  perform  at  high  levels,  win  at  all  costs,  and 
keep  playing,  even  when  they  get  hurt.  This  ‘no  pain, 
no  gain’  approach  is  extremely  stressful,  and  leads  to 
unnecessary  injuries.  Parents  should  therefore  take  care 
when  they  send  their  children  to  a  sports  camp,  and 
should  talk  with  the  sports  coaches  to  see  if  they  will 
respect  the  children’s  wishes.

In  choosing  the  most 

  sports  camp  for 
their  children,  parents  should  make  sure  that  the  coaches

They  all  reached  the  beach  two  hours  later,  exhausted 
but  safe.  At  that  time,  the  non-swimmer  thanked  Margo 
for  saving  his  life,  and  (a) he  asked  why  she  had  been  so 
insistent  about  going  slowly  and  quietly.  “Because,”  she 
said  to  him,  “for  one  thing,  I  knew  it  was  a  long  way  and 
we  had  to  conserve  our  energy.  For  another,  that  ocean  is 
full  of  sharks  and  I  didn’t  care  to  attract  their  attention. 
But  if  I’d  told  you  that,  you  might  have  panicked  and 
none  of  us  would  have  made  it.”

Margo  took  charge.  She  shouted  out  orders.  She  told 
each  person  to  take  a  wooden  board,  use  it  as  a  float, 
and  begin  kicking  slowly  toward  shore.  She  ordered 
(b) the  non-swimmer  to  share  a  piece  of  board  with  her. 
“Kick  softly,”  she  told  him,  “Don’t  stir  up  the  water 
more  than  you  have  to.”  With  Margo’s  firm  presence 
next  to  him,  the  non-swimmer  avoided  panic.  When 
every  now  and  then  his  kicking  became  awkward  and 
noisy,  Margo  ordered 
to  stop.  Slowly  and

quietly,  the  five  moved  toward  the  distant  shore.

Margo  was  on  holiday  with  friends,  three  miles  off 
the  Kenyan  coast  in  the  Indian  Ocean,  in  a  fishing  boat. 
Suddenly  the  engine  died,  and  for  mysterious  reasons, 
the  boat  began  to  sink.  Before  they  knew  what  was 
happening,  Margo,  her  three  friends,  and  (d) the  African 
boatman  were  in  the  sea.  They  all  had  life  jackets,  but 
it  was  a  long  way  to  shore.  Around  them  were  lots  of 
wooden  barrels  and  boards.  At  that  moment,  (e) one  of 
the  three  friends  said,  “I  don’t  know  how  to  swim.”

Person  A Most  people  agree  that  fruit  is  a  valuable, 
healthy  food.  Nonetheless,  they  usually  throw  away  a 
the  peel.  In  fact,  fruit 
very  nutritious  part  of  the  fruit
peel  contains  essential  vitamins  and  is  a  source  of  dietary 
fiber.  Dietary  fiber  helps  to  lower  the  level  of  cholesterol 
and  blood  sugar,  which  reduces  the  risk  of  heart  disease 
and  diabetes.  Fiber  also  helps  to  lessen  calorie  intake, 
because  people  don’t  feel  hungry  even  though  they  eat 
less.  Eating  fruit  peel  can  also  help  to  decrease  the 
amount  of  food  waste  which  is  a  cause  of  pollution. 
Finally,  I  think  people  who  eat  fruit  peel  prefer  organic 
food,  which  encourages  farmers  to  use  less  pesticide  and 
thus  to  contribute  to  a  cleaner  environment. 

Person  B Personally,  I  don’t  like  the  bitter  taste  and 
roughness  of  fruit  peel,  though  I  understand  that  it  has 
some  nutritious  value  and  contains  dietary  fiber.  Even 
so,  I  don’t  think  it  is  wise  to  eat  fruit  without  peeling 
it.  You  might  think  you’re  removing  all  the  pesticide  on 
the  fruit  when  you  wash  it,  but  some  chemicals  are 
bound  to  remain  on  the  surface  of  the  peel.  The  use  of 
detergent  to  clean  the  fruit  can  also  cause  additional 
water  pollution.  Another  reason  for  removing  the  peel 
before  eating  is  that  some  fruits  such  as  apples,  pears, 
and  grapes  have  a  tough  skin,  which  can  be  harder  to 
chew  and  to  digest.
