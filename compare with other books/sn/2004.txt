것은? [2점]

I have been living in this foreign country for five years.

Near my house is a tiny dry-cleaning shop run by two

chatty old ladies. They are probably in their 60s, which

isn t all that old, but their service is slow enough to say,

It takes forever . Sometimes they try my patience. Once

I had to go back five times to pick up a couple of

items. My, you are in a hurry,

they cheerfully said.

How slow of us! We are terrible! Despite the slow

service,

their shop is constantly packed with customers

and their counter piled high with clothes. This I do not

understand at all.

19. 밑줄 친 gourd에 대한 필자의 생각으로 가장 적절한 것은?

A few years ago, I was traveling in the country when

I came upon a well. Next

to the well, I found a gourd,

the traditional Korean dipper . Feeling thirsty, I took the

gourd, dipped some water, and drank . While satisfying

my thirst, I thought about

the many travelers who must

have come to the same well and drunk from th e sam e

gourd. They,

like me, were able to satisfy their thirst.

I

felt a closeness to these travelers. At

that m oment,

I realized that the gourd was not just a tool for drinking

but also a link between myself and other people who

were also traveling through life.

Though we cannot dismiss Mr. Smith s opinion completely,

his argument is not persuasive. Contrary to what Mr. Smith

may believe,

the role of computers in music and the

performing arts has been considerable. Computer technology

can improve how a work is performed, broadcast, and

experienced. Composers, performers, and audience can all

have digital control of their music. If today s top rock singer

released his or h er next piece on the Internet, it would

not only be like playing in a theater with 20 million seats,

but each listener could also transform the music depending

upon his or her own personal tastes.

The rainforests are full of plants and animals that need

each other and help each other . For example, the ant plant

has tunnels in its stems which are just right for ants to live
in. ① The ants put bits of dead insects inside some of the
tunnels, and then the ant plant uses them for food. ② The

ants also look after a caterpillar which lives inside the ant
plant and eats its leaves. ③ Because of this, the ants come
out of the ground and attack the caterpillar . ④ In return, the

caterpillar makes a special honey mixture which the ants
eat. ⑤ In this way, these three all live together in harmony.

In making a successful school, we must consider the
relationships among the people involved in the school
community . Teachers need to know their students well in
order to be able to teach them effectively . In addition,
teachers must maintain a good relationship with the
parents, who are also an important part of
the total
community .

seems

to b e

constantly

ch anging .

If we

observe nature closely, however, we discover that

there

is a constant

tension between change and balance. In

the case of human being s,

the g eneral shape and size

of our body rem ains relatively constant while the cells

within it are continually being replaced. Likewise,

the

forest rem ain s a forest, ev en while individual

trees and

grasses are removed by death and replaced by birth .

The dead bodies of organism s in the forest are broken

down and turn ed into soil, which in turn nourish es

other organisms. The elem ents of nature are continually
changing, but n ature itself remains constant. [2점]

[49∼50] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.

(A)

These new technologies have another benefit for biologists

by allowing them to gain access to the unknown world of

communication between animals. For centuries, biologists

believed giraffes were the silent giants of Africa. In recent

years, however, biologists have been able to listen more

carefully by means of these technologies and have realized

that giraffes may talk, though not in a way that we can hear.

(B)

Communication through infrasound is not

limited to

giraffes. Over the last few decades, biologists have found

that whales, elephants, and some other animals also use this

extremely

low-pitched

sound

to

communicate. This

infrasound, as a means of communication, has special merit:

It can travel a greater distance than higher-pitched noise.

Such long-distance communication is a must for animals

such as giraffes or elephants that roam over wide areas.

(C)

Infrasound is a low-pitched sound, whose frequency is far
below the range of human ears. Scientists, however, have
been able to discover the existence of infrasound by using
special technologies. These new technologies have revealed
that many things can produce infrasound, from earthquakes
and thunderstorms to trains and underground explosions, thus
and the
making possible the warning of
monitoring of underground nuclear-explosion tests.
