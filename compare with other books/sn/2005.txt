they would have to be the original painter to know

of the work, such as dirt removal, are quite straightforward.
What is important is to bring a painting back to an artist s
intent. In order to do so, they have to decide if

they should add something to the painting or leave it as it
is. They admit
is extremely difficult to determine what
should and should not be retouched. Our goal is to respect

You may have had this experience. A person calls you
on the telephone. Apparently assuming you will recognize
her voice, she does not provide any verbal content which
would help you identify her. For example, you pick up
the phone and say, Hello,
and the voice on the other
end says, Hi, how are you doing? At this point you
realize you don t know who it is! So you try to extend
the conversation without admitting your ignorance, hoping
some verbal clues will be given or that you ll eventually

silence. He just shrugged and said, Sorry, kid. And then
