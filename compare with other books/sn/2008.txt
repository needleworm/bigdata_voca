applied  only  to  American  coins,  but  the  intention  is  that

will  be  easier  to  get  started.  When  starting,  don’t  worry 
about  what  the  reader  will  think  about  what  you  have 
written.  Make  writing  as  easy  for  you  as  you  can  by  not 
being  concerned  with  how  good  the  first  draft  is.  There

perception  seems  to  work  the  same  way.  Notice  that 
when  seen  as

any  bump  or

The  features  in  Figure  B  are  basically 
those  in  Figure  A,  but,  out  of  context,  they  are  less 
identifiable.  As  in  Figure  C,  we  actually  require  a  more 
simplified  presentation  than  in  Figure  B,  to  identify 
facial  features  unambiguously  when  presented  in  isolation. 
Thus,  our  understanding  of  context  compensates  for 

lack  of  detail  in  the  feature  identification  process.

A  boy  entered  a  coffee  shop  where  I  worked  as  a 
waitress.  He  sat  at  a  table  and  asked  me  how  much  an  ice 
cream  sundae  was.  “Fifty  cents,”  I  replied.  The  little  boy 
pulled  his  hand  out  of  his  pocket  and  studied  a  number  of 
coins  in  it.  “How  much  is  a  dish  of  plain  ice  cream?”  he 
inquired.  Some  people  were  now  waiting  for  a  table,  and  I 
was  impatient.  “Thirty-five  cents,”  I  said  angrily.  The  little 
boy  again  counted  the  coins  and  he  ordered  the  plain  ice 
cream.  I  brought  the  ice  cream  and  walked  away.  The  boy 
finished,  paid  the  cashier,  and  departed.  When  I  came 
back,  I  swallowed  hard  at  what  I  saw.  There,  placed 
neatly  beside  the  empty  dish,  were  fifteen  pennies

One  key  social  competence 

is  how  well  or  poorly 
people  express  their  own  feelings.  Paul  Ekman  uses  the 
term  ‘display  rules’  for  the  social  agreement  about  which 
feelings  can  be  properly  shown  when.  Cultures  sometimes 
vary  tremendously  in  this  regard.

reactions  of  students  to  a  horrific  film  about  a  teenage 
Aboriginal  ritual  ceremony.  When  the  students  watched 
the  film  with  an  authority  figure  present,  their  faces 
showed  only  the  slightest  hints  of  reaction.

when  they  thought  they  were  alone  (though  they  were

We  have  to  ask  ourselves  a  question.  What  kind  of 
world  will  our  children  have  to  live  in?  Will  they  have 
air  to  breathe  and  food  to  eat?  These  are  among  the 
basic  questions  that  were  addressed  at  the  first  world 
meeting  on  the  environment,  attended  by  more  than  100 
world  leaders  and  30,000  other  scientists,  newspeople,  and 
citizens  concerned.  These  complex  problems  can  no  longer 
be  solved  by  individual  countries.  Nations  of  the  world 
must  act  together  if  we  are  to  develop  answers  that  will 
give  a  safe  and  healthy  world  to  our  children.  World 
leaders  should  have  the  vision  to  protect  our  environment.

There  is  healing  power  in  flowers

and  in  trees,  fresh 
air,  and  sweet-smelling  soil.  Just  walking 
through  a 
garden  or,  for  that  matter,  seeing  one  out  your  window, 
can  lower  blood  pressure,  reduce  stress,  and  ease  pain. 
Get  out  there  and  start  digging,  and  the  benefits  multiply. 
While  it  may  be  basic  and  even  old-fashioned,  using 
gardening  as  a  health  care  tool  is  blossoming.  New  or 
remodeled  hospitals  and  nursing  homes  increasingly  come 
equipped  with  healing  gardens  where  patients  and  staff 
can  get  away  from  barren,  indoor  surroundings.  Many 
also  offer  patients  a  chance  to  get  their  hands  dirty  and 
their  minds  engaged  in  caring  for  plants.

Most  of  us  buy  our  food  from  supermarkets.  In  fact, 

many  of  us  don’t  even  get  as  far  as  the  supermarket  but 
make  our  choices  at  the  click  of  a  mouse.  We  have 
abandoned  our  relationship  with  the  food  we  eat  and  with 
the  people  who  produce  our  food.  Is  it  any  wonder  that 
our  children  don’t  know  where  food  comes  from?  Is  it 
any  wonder  that  we’re  tired,  overweight,  irritable,  and 
low?  It  is  important  to  be  mindful  about  every  single 
aspect  of  purchasing  food.  Try  not  to  race  through  your 
shopping.  In  my  hometown,  nobody  would  buy  a  melon 
without  feeling  it  and  smelling  it;  and  nobody  would 
dream  of  buying  a  chicken  without  knowing  which  farm 
it  came  from  and  what  it  ate.

Recreational  tree  climbing

Recreational  tree  climbing  is  an  evolving  sport.  It  got 
its  start  in  1983,  when  Peter  Jenkins  began  teaching  all 
sorts  of  people,  including  children,  how  to  climb  trees 
safely  using  a  rope  and  a  harness  and  the  recreational 
tree  climbing  technique.  In  the  United  States,  it  is  now 
practiced  by  a  thousand  or  so  people  but  is  rapidly 
growing  in  popularity.  However,  those  who  study  rare 
plants  are  worried  about  recreational  tree  climbers.  They 
fear  that  these  climbers  may  try  to  climb  the  biggest  and 
locations.  Any 
tallest 
contact  between  humans  and  rare  plants  can  be  disastrous 
for  the  plants.

many  more  selves  and  kinds  of  experience  than  any  one

enable  us  to  seek  through  literature  an  enlargement  of  our 
experience.  Although  we  may  see  some  characters  as 
that  is,  we  may  not  identify  with  them 
outside  ourselves
completely we  are  nevertheless  able  to  enter  into  their 
behavior  and  their  emotions.  Thus,  the  youth  may  identify 
with  the  aged,  one  gender  with  the  other,  and  a  reader  of 
a  particular  limited  social  background  with  members  of  a 
different  class  or  a  different  period.

A  status  symbol  is  something,  usually  an  expensive  or 
rare  object,  that  indicates  a  high  social  status  for  its  owner. 
What  is  considered  a  status  symbol  will  differ  among 
countries,  based  on 
their  economic  and 
the  states  of 
technological  development,  and  common  status  symbols  will 
change  over  time.  Status  symbols  can  indicate  the  cultural 
values  of  a  society.  Let’s  take  some  examples.  In  a  society 
that  cherishes  honor  or  bravery,  a  battle  wound  would  be 
more  of  a  status  symbol.  In  a  commercial  society,  where 
having  money  or  wealth  is  most  important,  things  that  can 
be  brought  by  wealth,  such  as  cars,  houses,  or  fine 
clothing,  are  considered  status  symbols.  And  in  a  society 
where  people  craze  for  beauty,  the  condition  of  one’s  skin 
and  body  can  be  a  status  symbol.

However,  when  you  try  to  tickle  yourself,  you  are  in 
complete  control  of  the  situation. 

Why  is  it  that  if  you  tickle  yourself,  it  doesn’t  tickle, 
but  if  someone  else  tickles  you,  you  cannot  stand  it?

to  remain  relaxed,  it  would  not  affect  you  at  all.  (

Of  course,  it  would  be  difficult  to  stay  relaxed,  because 
tickling  causes  tension  for  most  of  us,  such  as  feelings  of

therefore,  no  reaction.  (

are  characterized  by  different  frequencies  of  vibration. 
When  they  enter  the  eye  of  an  observer,  they  set  off  a 
chain  of  neurochemical  events,  the  end  product  of  which 
is  an 
that  we  call  color.  The

atoms  are  not  themselves  red.

may  come  up  with  four  age  groups
maturity,  and  old  age.  We  take  it  for  granted  that  people 
of  different  ages  behave  differently.  For  example,  we  feel 
that  a  man  in  his  thirties  should  act  his  age  and  not 
behave  like  an  adolescent  or  an  old  man.  Equally,  we 
expect  that,  as  they  go  through  life,  people  of  the  same 
age  will  in  some  ways  understand  each  other  better  than 
people  of  different  ages.  All  this  is  part  of  expected  ways 
of  behaving  in  our  social  life,  but  it  is  not  something  that 
we  can  apply 
institutions  governed  by 
hard-and-fast  rules.

I  knocked  at  the  door  and  was  told  to  enter.  I  found 
myself  in  a  large  room,  where  the  curtains  were  closed 
to  allow  no  daylight  in,  and  the  candles  were  lit.  In  the 
center  of  the  room,  sitting  at  a  table,  was  the  strangest 
lady  I  had  ever  seen.  She  was  wearing  a  wedding  dress 
made  of  rich  material.  She  had  a  bride’s  flowers  in  her 
hair,  but  her  hair  was  white.  She  only  had  one  white 
shoe  on.  Then  I  realized  that  over  the  years  the  flowers 
in  her  hair  had  died,  and  the  bride  inside  the  dress  had 
grown  old.  Everything  in  the  room  was  ancient.  The  only 
brightness  in  the  room  was  in  her  dark  old  eyes  that 
stared  at  me.

One  of  the  toughest  parts  of  isolation  is  a  lack  of  an 
expressive  exit.  With  anger,  you  can  get  mad  at  someone 
and  yell.  With  sadness,  you  can  cry.  But  isolation  feels 
like  being  in  a  room  with  no  way  out.

(A) For  people  who  cannot  push  themselves,  however,  support 
groups  are  a  good  cure  for  isolation.  They  offer  the 
opportunity  for  connection  in  a  safe  and  controlled  way. 

(B) And  the  longer  you  get  stuck  there,  the  harder  it 
becomes  to  share  the  pain  and  sorrow.  In  isolation, 
hope  disappears,  despair  rules,  and  you  can  no  longer 
see  a  life  beyond  the  invisible  walls  that  imprison  you.

(C) Some  people  find  it  helpful  to  work  gently  at  driving 
the  world.  In  one  case,  a

With  the  rise  of  the  social  sciences,  and  especially  the 
anthropology  of  the  1930s  and  thereafter,  words  like 
‘savage’  and  ‘primitive’  began  to  disappear  from  the 
vocabulary  of  cultural  studies,  along  with  the  notion  that 
the  people  who  had  once  borne  these  labels  represented 
a  biologically  less  evolved  form  of  humanity.  Medical 
science  could  find  no  difference  in  the  brains  of  the 
former  primitives  to  account  for  their  different  behavior; 
colonists  necessarily  observed  that  yesterday’s  ‘savage’ 
might  be  today’s  shopkeeper,  soldier,  or  servant.  As 
humanity  began  to  look  more  like  a  family  of  potential 
equals,  Westerners  had  to  accept  that  the  behavior 
found  in  native  cultures  was  not  the  distinctive  feature 
of  savage  ‘otherness’  but  the  expression  of  a  capacity 
that  may  exist,  for  better  or  for  worse,  in  all  of  us.

Person A In  ordinary  life,  you  can  be  very  comfortable 
with  modern  technology.  Just  as  people  search  for  books  in 
bookstores,  you  can  find  and  select  what  you  want  with  a 
computer.  You  have  already  seen  how  much  modern 
technology  has  changed  the  world.  You  can  talk  to  each 
other  in  real  time,  looking  at  each  other  on  a  palm-sized 
phone.  In  the  near  future,  I  believe  that  most  people  will 
wear  user-friendly  computer  equipment  making  their  daily 
lives  even  more  convenient.  This  would  give  us  the  chance 
to  find  information  quickly  and  communicate  with  others 
no  matter  where  we  are  or  what  we  are  doing.

Person B The  latest  devices  are  fun  to  use  for  many 
tasks  like  browsing  cyber  space,  but  it  is  important  to  keep 
your  distance  from  them  as  well.  The  constant  noises  of 
electronic  devices  like  computers,  mobile  phones,  fax 
machines,  stereos,  and  home  appliances  will  drown  out  the 
sounds  of  the  birds  singing  in  the  morning,  the  wind 
blowing  through  the  trees,  or  a  pencil  drawing  on  rough 
paper.  Modern  technology  is  addictive,  so  be  sure  to  plan 
days  away  from  its  electromagnetic  fields.  Go  out  into 
nature  and  leave  your  mobile  phone  behind.  Or  just  turn 
everything  off  and  ________________________.

(A) “There  is  a  good  reason  to  make  this  trip  to  the 
Island  of  Paradise,”  Captain  Koppe  told  himself  as  he 
stepped  out  of  the  elevator  car  into  the  covered  rooftop 
hangar  of  his  house.  The  journey  itself  would  be  of  use. 
There  were  times  when  it  was  important  to  be  alone,  to 
have  time  to  think.  Alone  even  from  one’s  personal 
robot,  from  one’s  trusted  wife.

(B) The  outer  doors  opened,  and  the  aircar  slowly 
eased  out  into  the  driving  rain.  Suddenly,  (a) it  was  in 
the  middle  of  the  storm,  jumping  and  swinging  in  the 
darkness,  the  rain  crashing  down  on  the  windows  with 
incredible  violence.  The  storm  boomed  and  roared  outside 
the  long-range  aircar  as  (b) it  fought  for  altitude,  the 
banging  and  clattering  getting  worse  with  every  moment.

(C) Smooth  sailing  after  the  storm,  the  aircar  arrived 
at  the  orbit  of  the  Island  of  Paradise.  Captain  Koppe 
looked  out  at  the  Island  through  the  window.  He  had 
been 
that 
longing  for  (c) it  since  his  childhood.  At 
moment,  his  family  picture  posted  on  the  inside  of  the 
aircar  came  into  his  eyes.  All  of  a  sudden,  he  had  an 
irresistible  urge  to  go  to  see  his  beloved  wife  and  his 
two  sons.  He  turned  his  back  on  the  Island  of  Paradise 
and  directed  (d) it  toward  the  homeland.

(D) Captain  Koppe  sensed  that  this  was  one  of  those 
times  when  he  had  to  be  alone
if  for  no  other  reason 
than  to  remind  himself  that  he  would  have  to  make  his 
decision  alone.  And  he  would  have  the  duration  of  the 
flight  all  to  himself.  The  thought  appealed  to  him  as  he 
powered  up  the  aircar  and  (e) it  lifted  a  half-meter  or  so 
off  the  deck  of  the  hangar.                            * hangar:
