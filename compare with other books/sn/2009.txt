Hey, cheer up! Your mother is here to watch you.

Why didn’t you invite your mother to the competition?

Your mother has already left the swimming pool.

Peter, I didn’t know your mother is a good swimmer.

Congratulations! Finally, you beat your competitors.

This is different from all other markets in that people
do not buy things here such as clothes, shoes, or cars.
Thanks to this, people can easily exchange one country’s
money with that of another. People desire to make such
exchanges for many reasons. Some are concerned with
the import or export of goods or services between one
country and another. Others wish to move capital from
one area to another. Still others may want to travel to a
foreign country. This is incredibly important to the global
economy. This gets influenced by a real world event, and
has an impact on the economy of a nation, causing the
value of its money to rise and fall.

Woman: __________________________________________

I didn’t know you already returned the books.

It’s good to hear that you’ve saved a lot.

Borrow the books instead of buying them.

You have to be responsible for what you did.

I want to borrow some books from the library.

You should have slept more than that.

I’m sorry, but I can’t help you out.

Yeah. You’re really a great help.

No, thanks. I’ve had enough coffee.

Don’t worry! Just go to see a doctor.

Woman: ___________________________________________

Sure. That’s why I want to wear these clothes longer.

OK. I’ll go to the store and ask for a refund.

Certainly. I won’t buy second-hand items again.

You’re right. I’d like to take these clothes to the store.

That’s true. I’m not making the profit I expected.

Sheets of paper exist almost entirely for the purpose of
carrying information, so we tend to think of
them as
neutral objects. We rarely interpret marks on paper as
references to the paper itself.
, when we see the
text, characters, and images on artifacts that serve other
purposes, we generally interpret these marks as labels that
do refer to their carriers. Natural objects do not come with
labels, of course, but
these days, most physical artifacts
do.
, their designers have chosen to shift part of
the burden of communication from the form and materials
of the artifact itself to lightweight surface symbols. So, for
example, a designer of door handles might not worry about
functions through their shapes, but

understanding of emotions, and it is no truer than the flat
earth. It sees the brain as a steam kettle in which negative
feelings build up pressure. But no psychologist has ever
succeeded in proving the unburdening effects of
the
supposed safety valves of tears and anger. On the contrary,
over forty years ago, controlled studies showed that fits of
anger are more likely to intensify anger, and that tears can
drive us still deeper
into depression. Our heads do not
resemble steam kettles, and our brains involve a much
more complicated system than can be accounted for by
images taken from nineteenth-century technology.

perform other jobs that helped develop the civilization.

Most people have a vase or two in a cupboard, but lots
of things can be turned into stylish containers for a flower
arrangement, so before you rush out to buy anything, look
around your own home. For instance, goldfish bowls look
stunning filled with flower heads or petals, magnifying
their contents. Wine, milk, mineral water, or olive oil
bottles look particularly good with one or two stems in
them. Try a collection of bottles in various shapes and
sizes,
lined up on a shelf or grouped on a table. An old
teapot which has lost its lid becomes an ideal container for

Everywhere in the world, the issue of how to manage
urban growth poses the highest stakes, complex policy
decisions, and strongly heated conflicts in the public
area. The contrast between Western Europe and America
is particularly sharp. In Western Europe, steep gasoline
taxes,
investment policies favoring built-up areas over
undeveloped greenfields, continuous investment in public
transportation, and other policies have produced relatively
compact cities. Cities in Western Europe tend to be
economically healthy compared with their suburbs. By
contrast,
cheap gas, massive
highway investment, policies that favor construction on
the edges of cities, and heavy reliance on property taxes
to fund public schools have encouraged much more
car-reliant and spread-out urban areas, where eight in ten
Americans now live.
